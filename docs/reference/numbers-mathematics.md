# Numbers and Mathematics

These are the words that all numbers in Kokanu are built from: 

$wan - 1 (one)

$ha - 2 (two)

$san - 3 (three)

$nanku - 4 (four)

$lima - 5 (five)

$loku - 6 (six)

$setan - 7 (seven)

$etu - 8 (eight)

$saka - 9 (nine)

$tiju - 10 (ten)

$sijen - 100 (hundred)

$con - 1000 (thousand)

When building phrases to express numbers, number words that follow $tiju don't act as modifiers, as would normally be the case in Kokanu, they simply add a unit number on.

$tiju $ha "ten and two, 12"

Number words preceding $tiju give the number of instances of it, as with any noun.

$etu $tiju "eight tens, 80"

Placing unit numbers before and after $tiju allows the expression of any number up to 99.

$san $tiju $ha "three tens and two, 32"

The number $sijen acts exactly like $tiju. Placing unit numbers before and after $sijen allows the expression of any number up to 999.

$lima $sijen $loku "five hundreds and six, 506"

$setan sijen ha tiju saka "seven hundreds and two tens and nine, 729"

The number $con acts similarly. Placing unit numbers before and after $con allows the expression of any number up to 9999.

$ha $con $lima "two thousands and five, 2005"

$nanku $con $ha $sijen $saka $tiju $etu "four thousands and two hundreds and nine tens and eight, 4298"

The number $nula is used for "zero", though, like in English, it doesn't appear in compound whole number words.


Forming Numbers 10000 and larger
-------------------------------

Powers of a 10 can also be expressed with $hen, followed by an exponent. For example,

$hen $ha "10², one hundred" (Note: the number $wan does not have to precede $hen)

$hen $lima "10⁵, one hundred thousand"

$hen $loku "10⁶, one million"

$hen $saka "10⁹, one billion"

It’s important to think of $hen as “ten to the power of...” rather than just “10” (which is $tiju). 
If $hen is used multiple times or other digits follow it, each $hen exponent is followed by $hu. 
But in all instances, $hu can be replaced by a verbal pause or a written comma. 

$lima **$hen $lima $hu**, $ha **$hen $nanku $hu**, $lima $con $loku $sijen "525,600"

$san **$hen $loku**, $nanku **$hen $lima**, $nanku **$hen $nanku**, $loku $con $setan $tiju $etu "3,446,078"

$etu $hen $tiju $ha "8,000,000,000,000, 8 trillion"

$etu $hen $tiju, $ha "80,000,000,002, eighty billion two"


Cardinals and Ordinal Numbers
-----------------------------

**Cardinal numbers** are placed **before a noun**. These are used for counting **how many** or **how much** of something there is.

$mi $le $han $in **$san** **$pawo** "I have **three dogs**"

$mi $le $tun **$tiju** **$etu** **$osa** **$matin** "I have been working for **eighteen hours**

**Ordinal numbers** are placed **after the noun** These are used to specify the position of an item in a series, like "fourth" or "seventeenth".

**$pawo $ha** $le $tope $ani "**The second dog** is the best"

**$san $ten** $melon $je **$osa** ****$tiju** $etu** $le $conca "It is 18:03" (literally "**three minutes** after the **eighteenth hour** have passed")

Therefore, when telling time, $san $osa is used to mean "three hours", and "$osa $san" to mean "three o'clock", literally "third hour".

Fractions, Decimals, and Percents
---------------------------------

Numbers with fractional components tend to be more complex to express in Kokanu than whole numbers.

In **fractions**, the numerator is expressed as a number of $osa, "parts", which are described by the denominator with $je. 

$san $osa $je $lima "three parts of five, three five-parts, 3/5"

$ha $tiju $nanku $osa $je $ha $sijen $san $tiju $wan "24/231"

For **decimals** the whole number is simply followed by $pintu, "point", and the decimal numbers follow consecutively, with no regard for hundreds or thousands places.

$ha $pintu $san $ha $nanku $nanku - 12.3244

$san $pintu $wan $nanku $wan $lima $saka $ha... - 3.141592...

For **percentages** the phrase **osa je sijen** is added to the end of the number. This can be combined with decimal notation to specify decimal percentages.

$ha $tiju $lima $osa $je $sijen - 25%

$nanku $tiju $pintu $etu $setan $wan $osa $je $sijen - 40.871%

Negative Numbers
----------------

**Negative numbers** are expressed with $opotu $je, "opposite of..."

$opotu $je $san "-3"

$opotu $je $nanku $osa $je $tiju "-4/10"

$opotu $je $loku $pintu $saka $saka "-6.99"

Mathematical Operations
-----------------------

While no words are specially assigned for mathematical operations such as "addition" or "multiplication", other words can be used to describe the operations and will be understood in a mathematical context.

Addition

2 + 3

$te $tene $in $san $ki $ha "giving 3 to 2"

$te $pon $ta $ha $le $unitu $kan $san "combining 2 with 3"

2 + 3 = 5

$ha $un $san $le $lima "2 and 3 is 5"

Subtraction

7 - 4

$te $lun $lipan $in $nanku $sun $setan "to make-absent 4 from 7"

$te $alu $in $nanku $sun $setan "to take 4 from 7"

7 - 4 = 3

$setan $un $opotu $je $nanku $le $san "7 and -4 is 3"

Multiplication

2 \* 5

$te $tun $in $ha $non $je $lima - "creating 2 groups of 5"

$te $lun $lan $in $ha $wija $lima "to make-many 2 with 5"

2 \* 5 = 10

$ha $non $je $lima $le $tiju "2 groups of 5 is 10"

$lima $mita $je $ha $le $tiju "5 amounts of 2 is 10"

Division

9 / 4

$te $lun $panli $in $saka $wija $nanku "to cut 9 using 4"

9 / 4 = 2.25

$nanku $panli $je $saka $le $ha $pintu $ha $lima "4 divisions of 9 is 2.25"

$saka $osa $je $nanku $le $ha $pintu $ha $lima - expressing 9/4 in standard **fraction** form directly

Exponentiation

6³

$te $lun $lan $in $loku $wija $sa $an $san $ten - "to make-many 6 using itself 3 times"

6³ = 216

$san $mita $saman $je $loku $le $ha $sijen $tiju $loku "3 identical bunches of 6 is 216"
