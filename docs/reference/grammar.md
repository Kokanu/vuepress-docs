# Grammar
The essential details to get a grasp on Kokanu grammar and start exploring how to express yourself and communicate. The coverage is very fast paced and minimally detailed, more detailed articles are linked if you want to expand your knowledge of a given area.

This guide assumes you have some familiarity with the Kokanu vocabulary. Words that directly affect the grammar are explained here in the guide, but other words used in the example sentences will not. You **click** on any Kokanu word to see a definition of the word.

Pronunciation
-------------

The letters **p**, **t**, **k**, **w**, **l**, **m**, **n**, **s**, and **h** are all pronounced the same as their equivalents in the IPA and in English.

The letter **j** is pronounced like its equivalent in the IPA, which is the sound of the letter **y** in “yellow”. The letter **c** is pronounced like ​​/tʃ/ in the IPA, which is the sound of the digraph **ch** in “chat”.

The vowels **a**, **e**, **i**, **o**, and **u** are pronounced the same as their equivalents in the IPA. Spanish is a common example of a language with all these sounds. The only two that are pronounced on their own in English are **i**, like the digraph **ee** in “see”, and **o** like the **o** in “cold”. The letter **u** is pronounced like the end of diphthong in the word \`tow\`, similar to the English exclamation “oooo”, with the tongue resting completely. The letter **a** is close to the **a** in the word “ash” or the **a** in “malt”  but with the tongue much more relaxed, not raised like in "ash" or pushed back like in "malt". The letter **e** is close to the **e** in “get” but with the tongue more raised like **i** in "see", around the halfway point between the two.    

For those that cannot pronounce some of these sounds exactly, there shouldn't be a problem as long as each one is pronounced differently from all the others. The sounds of the language are limited and spaced out in the mouth such that each letter can be approximated in a variety of ways without sounding too much like any other letter. Ask in the discord for help if you struggle with any of the pronunciations, and you will likely find a pronunciation that works for you.

Base Forms
----------

Every word has one base form, either base **noun**, base **verb**, or base **modifier**. Any word can act in any form, but its base determines how it acts in other forms. You can always distinguish when a word is being used as a **noun**, **verb** or **modifier**.

Verbs are marked by the particles $le and $o.

$men $mi $le $makan “I eat”

**Nouns** are marked by the **prepositions**, like $men, $in, $ki, and $wija

$men $mi $le $makan $in $makan “I eat food”

**Modifiers** are activated when placed after a **noun** or **verb**.

$men $mi $le $makan $wiki $in $kuwosi $makan “I quickly eat an edible fruit”

### Relations between action and noun phrases

The structure of a Kokanu sentence is formed from an **action phrase**, marked by $le or $o, surrounded by **noun phrases** which relate to the action in some way. $men marks a **noun phrase** which is the **agent** of the action. $in marks a **noun phrase** which is the object of the action. $ki marks a **noun phrase** which is the recipient of the action. $wija marks a **noun phrase** which is the instrument of the action. The **action phrases** and **noun phrases** can be placed in any order as long as they are marked properly.

$wija $moto $in $makan $le $tajali $men $mi “I prepare food using fire”, “I cook food”

When the subject is at the _start_ of a sentence, however, $men can be dropped.

$men $mi $le $makan  
$mi $le $makan

**Prepositions**, $le, and $o can be negated by placing $no after them. $no does not serve any other function.

These three sentences mean the same thing but have different emphasis:

$mi $le $no $makan $in $kuwosi “I don’t eat fruit” (but I may do something else to it)

$mi $le $makan $in $no $kuwosi “I don’t eat fruit” (but I may eat something else)  

$men $no $mi $le $makan $in $kuwosi “I don’t eat fruit” (but someone/thing else may)

Conjunctions in Kokanu can be between nouns in a phrase, or between sentences.

$mi $le $makan $in $kuwosi $un $ukama “I eat fruits and vegetables”

$mi $le $makan $in $kuwosi $un $mi $le $lo $sun $jan $ne “I eat fruits and I leave”

An imperative statement is created by replacing a **subject** + $le with just $o (no subject).

$tu $le $lo “you move”

$o $lo “move!”

### Relations between words within phrases

**Modifiers** come after a **noun** to indicate an **adjective**, or after a **verb** to indicate an **adverb**. **Quantity words** serve ordinary functions as **modifiers**, but have an additional quantity function when _preceding_ a word.

$kuwosi $wan “first fruit”

$wan $kuwosi “one fruit”

$tope $lan “very good”

$lan $tope “several goodnesses”

$lan $mi “we”

The word $je is similar to the word “of” in English. The word following it is always derived as a **noun**.

$tipa $makan “edible box”

$tipa $je $makan “food box”, "lunchbox"

$kuwosi $ha $mi “my second fruit”

$kuwosi $je $ha $mi "us two’s fruit”

The word $wa marks a **modifier** without any **noun** or **verb** needing to precede it, and applies to the entire phrase before it.

$kuwosi $je $ha $mi $wa $hunsi “us two’s red fruit”

### Relations between clauses within phrases

$ta starts a new clause (sentence within a sentence), while $te starts a new clause and marks the first word as a **verb**. The $te clause can modify a noun, and in these cases the noun being modified is the **subject** of the clause.

$nin $te $makan "person who eats"

$te can also be used without modifying a noun to create a clause that **starts with a verb** anywhere in a sentence, but the clause must end with a comma if more comes after it.

$te $makan $in $kuwosi, $le $tope "eating fruit is good"

$ta functions like $te, except that it doesn't mark the first word that follows it as a verb, so the clause may start with a subject or any other preposition. It is simple to use when not modifying a noun.

$ta $mi $le $makan $in $kuwosi, $le $tope "it's good that I eat fruit"

$mi $le $pon $in $ta $tu $le $pasan "I cause that you are happy", "I make you happy"

When $ta does modify a noun, it is more complicated. $te tells you that the noun being modified is the **subject** of the following clause, $ta doesn't say anything about the role of the noun being modified in the clause.

$nin $ta $mi $le $suki might seem like a direct translation from English "person that I like", but in Kokanu it's meaningless. The clause $mi $le $suki sits next to the word $nin with no relation between them. It would be like saying in English "place that I go". You have to establish the role of "place" in the clause "I go", i.e. "place that I go **to**" where "to" tells you that "place" is the direction/goal of the clause "I go". Kokanu does this in a very similar way.

$nin $ta $mi $le $suki $in "person that I like", where $in indicates the role of $nin in the **relative clause**.

**Sentence:** $mi $le $suki $in $nin "I like the person"  
**Noun:** $nin $ta $mi $le $suki $in "person that I like"

Any **preposition** can be used to make this relation.

$jan $ta $mi $le $lo $ki "place that I go to"

$jon $ta $mi $le $tun $in $ne $wija "tool that I do this with/using"

The **preposition** at the end of the clause is called a "dangling preposition", and it's the preposition that would have been used on the modified noun in a normal sentence, e.g. "**the place** that I go **to**," "I go **to the place**" 

Alternatively, unlike in English, the clause can be written out as a full sentence, where $ja refers back to the noun being modified. 

*   $nin $ta $in $ja $men $mi $le $suki
*   $nin $ta $mi $in $ja $le $suki
*   $nin $ta $mi $le $suki $in $ja

In the last example, $ja can be dropped from the end, leaving the dangling preposition, which is how it's always done in English.

In any case, the clause must end with a comma if more follows.

$kuwosi $ta $nin $le $makan $in, $le $tope

### Coupling Word Particles

$wi and $mu are particles that apply to the next word only, creating a "coupling". $wi forces **modifiers**

$sikin $wi no $konen “improbable event”

$kuwosi $wi no $makan “inedible fruit”

For more information, check out our $Coupling Modifier Negator guide.

$mu constructs a noun that is a "doer" of an action, or the **agent** of the action.

$mu $kanisa “thinker”

To make the **agent** _cause_ the action rather than _do_ the action, you can make $pon the action of $mu, with the actual action joined by $je.

$mu $tiku “dier”

$mu $pon $je $tiku “killer”
