# lun

$lun is a particle that turns words into a verb meaning "to \<word\>-ify X" or "to make X into \<word\>".

#### Use

Now, importantly, whether the word is interpreted as a modifier or a noun is important to the meaning. For example, if in $lun $tope, $tope is intepreted as a noun, then $lun $tope would mean "to make into goodness", *not* "to make good". Simiarly, if in $lun $nin, $nin is intepreted as a modifier, then $lun $nin wouldn't mean "to make into a person", it would mean "to make similar to a person".

One is making the object *like* the word, whereas the other is making the object *be* the word. Whether $lun is using its modifier meaning or its noun meaning is dependent on context, and on the argument it's taking in.

If a noun is passed as the argument for $lun, so for example, $lun $nin, the default lean is that $lun is using its *noun meaning*. This would mean that defaultly, $lun $nin means "to make into a person", *not* "to make similar to a person".

The same goes for modifiers. Defaulty, $lun $tope means "to make good", *not* "to make into goodness".

However, this is dependent on context, and can be specified if you want to mean something that is not $lun's default lean.

To specify that you're using $lun's *noun meaning*, you can add $wen before the argument. So to specify that you're trying to mean "to make into goodness", you could say $lun **$wen** $tope.

Simiarly, to specify that you're using $lun's *modifier meaning*, you can add $wi before the argument. So to specify that you're trying to mean "to make similar to a person", you could say $lun **$wi** nin.

And lastly, it should be noted that this verb, isn't really grammatically a verb. It makes more sense to think of it as a verb, however it cannot be used when not in front of $le or $o. For example, the sentence $lun $tope $le $tope would be ungrammatical.
