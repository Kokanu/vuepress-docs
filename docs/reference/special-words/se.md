# se

All sentences that make a statement require a verb in Kokanu. Although you can say things like "he nin maku", or "naki la", these sentences are not describing some sort of event, and are rather calls or reactions.

You could not say, for example, "I am at the house", without a verb being present in the sentence.

Therefore, the way to say "I am at the house" would be:<br>
$mi $le $se $pi $niwa

You could not just say "$mi $pi $niwa", as this would just mean the sentence fragment "I, at the house". Without the verb marker $le or $o being used, the sentence does not have an action.

Remember that prepositions can be placed in any order. If you wanted to say "Me at the house", you'd have to say $mi *$te* $pi $niwa.

Saying "\<noun\> $le $se \<preposition\>" is quite a common structure, and is used for saying sentences such as:<br>
$ja $le $se $nenka $na $sin. - "It exists because of that thing"<br>
$mi $le $se $kan $ja. - "I am with him"<br>
$na $pawo $le $se $sun $Kanata. - "That dog is from Canada"

Due to how common this structure is, $se is allowed to be dropped if it is between $le and another preposition. So instead of needing to say:<br>
$mi $le $se $pi $na $jan "I exist at that place"

You could say:<br>
$mi $le $pi $na $jan "I exist at that place" (exact same meaning)

This means that any structure that matches "le se \<preposition\>" can have its "se" dropped. (i.e. "le se \<preposition\>" -> "le \<preposition\>").

It should be noted that due to the fact that $se can be dropped, and is often dropped, including the $se often has a connotation more of focusing on the existance of the object, rather than on the preposition after the $se.

So the sentences:<br>
$mi $le $se $pi $niwa - "I exist at the house", and<br>
$mi $le $pi $niwa - "I am at the house

Despite both grammatically meaning "I exist at the house", pragmatically communicate slightly different things.

The first, with $se, more communicates that you exist at the house, so the most accurate English translation for it would be "I exist at the house". Meanwhile, the second, by dropping the $se, is pragmatically more focused on the $pi $niwa part, and as such, would be most accurately translated to "I am at the house" or "I'm at the house".
