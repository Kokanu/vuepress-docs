# se

All sentences that make a statement require a verb in Kokanu. Although you can say things like "he nin maku", or "naki la", these sentences are not describing some sort of event, and are rather calls or reactions.

You could not say, for example, "I am at the house", without a verb being present in the sentence.
Therefore, the way to say "I am at the house" would be:
$mi $le $se $pi $niwa

You could not just say "$mi $pi $niwa", as this would just mean the sentence fragment "I, at the house". Without the verb marker $le or $o being used, the sentence does not have an action.
Remember that prepositions can be placed in any order. If you wanted to say "Me at the house", you'd say "$mi *$te* $pi $niwa".

However, since saying "<noun> $le $se <preposition>" is quite a common structure, and is used for saying sentences such as:
$ja $le $se $nenka $na $sin "It exists because of that thing"
$mi $le $se $kan $ja "I am with him"
$na $pawo $le $se $sun $Kanata "That dog is from Canada"

$se is allowed to be dropped if it is between $le and another preposition. So instead of needing to say:
$mi $le $se $pi $na $jan "I exist at that place"

You could say:
$mi $le $pi $na $jan

This can be applied to any structure which has $le and then a preposition right after. Any time that appears, an implicit "se" is being added between the two prepositions.
