# se

All sentences that make a statement require a verb in Kokanu. Although you can say things like "he nin maku", or "naki la", these sentences are not describing some sort of event, and are rather calls or reactions.

You could not say, for example, "I am at the house", without a verb being present in the sentence.
Therefore, the way to say "I am at the house" would be:
$mi $le $se $pi $niwa

You could not just say "$mi $pi $niwa", as this would simply mean the sentence fragment "I, at the house". Without the verb marker $le or $o being used, the sentence does not have an action.

However, due to the fact that saying "<noun> $le $se <preposition>" is quite a common structure, and is used for saying sentences such as:
$ja $le $se $nenka $na $sin "It exists because of that thing"
$mi $le $se $kan $ja "I am with him"
$na $pawo $le $sun $Kanata "That dog is from Canada"

It's easy enough to say something "is \$a base noun\ $le $len "I am strong"

This only works **if the word is already a base noun or base modifier**. What if it's a **base verb**? How do you say something "is food" or "is edible" using the other derivations of **makan**? You can't say **le makan**, because that means "is eating". What do you do?

The solution is to use the modifier **se** meaning "real" or "existing". As a verb it is used to mean "to be" or "to exist". This allows you to use **modifiers** or **wo**/**je** phrases to use **modifier** or **noun** forms of any word you please.

In linguistics, this "to be" construction is called the $**copula**.

$ne $le **se** $makan "This is edible", literally "This exists edibly"

$ne $le **se** $je $makan "This is food", literally "This exists \$in a manner\ $le $panli "That is divided", referring to the object that has been split

$na $le **se** $je $panli "That is a division", literally "that is dividedness" referring to the split in the object.

This allows you to use the **noun** or **modifier** form of **any word** when saying the phrase "is \$word\ **se** \$word\ **se** $je \$word\ **se** $je \$base modifier\ $le $cenpo, "this is large", than you'd say $ne $le **se** $je $cenpo, "this is largeness". In general this is most useful for using **base verbs** in their **noun** or **modifier** forms.

$Implicit se
-----------------------------------------------------------------

It does feel a bit clunky to be forced to use $le **se** $je to talk about noun forms all the time, so why not cut out a word? The **particle** $je can never be a **verb** itself, but when it comes immediately after $le it can be assumed that the **verb** is implicitly **se**. This shortens $le se $je to simply $le je.

$ne $le **se** $makan - "This is edible"

$ne $le $je $makan - "This is food"

$ja $le $tope $lan - "They are very good"

$ja $le $je $tope $lan - "They are the embodiment of much goodness"

$na $le $panli - "That is divided"

$na $le $je $panli - "That is a division"

This property of implicit **se** is also useful when using prepositions. Instead of saying $na $le **se** $po $tu, "that is for you", you could just say $na $le $po $tu and the **verb** **se** is simply implied.

$matuwa $mi $le $an  $- $"My parent is at the store"

$

$$kujo $mi $le $nenka $tu - "My sadness is because of you"
