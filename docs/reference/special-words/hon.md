# hon

This particle is used to attach context phrases to your sentences. With **hon**, you can place your context in any location within the sentence just like all of the other thematic relation markers. "Context" can be a wide variety of things. We will discuss using this marker for specifying a relative time for the entire sentence, evidentiality, and conditionals. 

### Relative Time

You can use the context marker to provide details about the timing of the event.

$mi $le $makan $in $kuwosi **hon** $kin $matin - "I ate fruit yesterday"

This could be interpreted as "a few days ago" or "in the past days", interpreting $kin as a plural, but that is often better represented with $lan $kin or $jati $kin.

**hon** $ten $nelo $je $kin $kenca $men $mi $le $makan $in $kuwosi - "Tonight I will eat fruit" (lit. as for the dark time of the present day, I eat fruit)
**hon** $ten $nelo $matin $men $mi $le $lo $ki $insu $je $makan - "Last night I went to the restaurant" (lit. as for the past dark time, I go to building of food)

Times are not _always_ relative to simple ideas like "today", "tomorrow", or "in three days". Sometimes, you need to talk about something relative to a specific event. For this, we state the context as literally "time that ...", with the $pi preposition dangling (or with $ja being used to close it off).

**hon** $ten $ta $mi $le $makan $matin $in $kuwosi $an, $men $mi $le $pasan - "When I ate fruit, I was happy"

Keep in mind, any references to time can also be made with the preposition $pi. This is especially true when referencing specific times that things happened.

For example the most natural translation for the sentence:

"When I saw her, I knew that she had stole my cookies"

Would be:

$pi $ta $mi $le $teka $in $ja, $mi $le $wisan $ta $ja $le $alu $in $makan $satu $mi

Using $hon in this sentence would actually have a different meaning, more akin to "*Given* that I saw her, I knew that she had stole my cookies".

Since $hon can always be replaced with $pi if time is being specified, depending on the context, using $hon instead of $pi can signify that you're talking *about* the time rather than putting the statement in the context *of* the time. However, in most situations, it's clear from context whether someone is putting the specific time as a topic of the sentence, or putting the sentence in the context of it.

Wait, $hon can be used to specify topics?

### Specifying Topics

If providing time as context makes a when-clause, what happens when you provide something that isn't a time? You end up simply specifying a topic. This can be used to introduce a new topic, to specify a relative concept in which to frame the following sentence, or to change topics similar to the English phrase "speaking of which...".

**hon** $pawo $men $mi $le $han $in $wan, $lekin $jan $tope $mi $le $han $in $nanku! - "Speaking of dogs, I have one but my friend has four!"

$tu $le $tope **hon** $kanisa $mi - literally "In the context of my thoughts, you are good", or roughly "you are good imo"

This is a somewhat awkward example, as it is more clearly stated using $mi $le $kanisa $ta $tu $le $tope, but it is still correct

**hon** $te $kota $tuntan $je Kokanu $men $tu $o $teka $in $pata $ta $non Kokanu $le $lika. - Roughly, "On the topic of Kokanu grammar, read this guide written by the Kokanu community."

More literally, it's "In the context of speaking Kokanu correctly, you should read this document that the Kokanu community wrote."

**hon** $lantan $ta $le $hunsi $matin, $men $mi $le $lun $nile $in $ja - "About the car that was red, I am making it blue"

Again, tense is fairly ambiguous here.

### Conditionals

When providing an entire event as context, it is usually interpreted as a conditional ("if \$event\ $mi $le $makan $in $kuwosi ... or **hon** $lantan $le $hunsi ...

**hon** $lantan $le $hunsi $men $mi $le $lun $nile $in $ja - "If the car is red, I will make it blue"

The tense of this sentence is ambiguous.

**hon** $lantan $le $hunsi $matin $men $mi $le $lun $nile $kate $in $ja - "If the car was red, I would have painted it blue"

Because the context is past tense, the main sentence is interpreted as what would have happened in that hypothetical past.

**hon** $tu $le $ju $ta $le $lo $ki $insu $je $makan $men $mi $le $ju $ta $le $lo $kan $tu - "If you want go to the restaurant, then I want to go with you
