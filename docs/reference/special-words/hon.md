# hon

This particle is used to attach context phrases to your sentences. With **hon**, you can place your context in any location within the sentence just like all of the other thematic relation markers. "Context" can be a wide variety of things. We will discuss using this marker for specifying a relative time for the entire sentence, evidentiality, and conditionals. 

### Relative Time

You can use the context marker to provide details about the timing of the event.

$mi $le $makan $in $kuwosi **hon** $kin $matin - "I ate fruit yesterday"

This could be interpreted as "a few days ago" or "in the past days", interpreting $kin as a plural, but that is often better represented with $lan $kin or $jati $kin.

**hon** $ten $nelo $je $kin $kenca $men $mi $le $makan $in $kuwosi - "Tonight I will eat fruit" (lit. as for the dark time of the present day, I eat fruit)<br>
**hon** $ten $nelo $matin $men $mi $le $lo $ki $insu $je $makan - "Last night I went to the restaurant" (lit. as for the past dark time, I go to building of food)

Times are not _always_ relative to simple ideas like "today", "tomorrow", or "in three days". Sometimes, you need to talk about something relative to a specific event. For this, we state the context as literally "time that ...", with the $pi preposition dangling (or with $ja being used to close it off).

**hon** $ten $ta $mi $le $makan $matin $in $kuwosi $an, $men $mi $le $pasan - "When I ate fruit, I was happy"

Keep in mind, any references to time can also be made with the preposition $pi. This is especially true when referencing specific times that things happened.

For example the most natural translation for the sentence:

"When I saw her, I knew that she had stole my cookies"

Would be:

$pi $ta $mi $le $teka $in $ja, $mi $le $wisan $ta $ja $le $alu $in $makan $satu $mi

Using $hon in this sentence would actually have a different meaning, more akin to "*Given* that I saw her, I knew that she had stole my cookies".

Since $hon can always be replaced with $pi if time is being specified, depending on the context, using $hon instead of $pi can signify that you're talking *about* the time rather than putting the statement in the context *of* the time. However, in most situations, it's clear from context whether someone is putting the specific time as a topic of the sentence, or putting the sentence in the context of it.

Wait, $hon can be used to specify topics?

### Specifying Topics

If providing time as context (sometimes) makes a when-clause, what happens when you provide something that isn't a time? You end up simply specifying a topic. This can be used to introduce a new topic, to specify a relative concept in which to frame the following sentence, or to change topics similar to the English phrase "speaking of which...".

**hon** $pawo $men $mi $le $han $in $wan, $lekin $matuwa $mi $le $han $in $nanku! - "Speaking of dogs, I have one, but my dad has four!"

$tu $le $tope **hon** $kanisa $mi - literally "In the context of my thoughts, you are good", or roughly "you are good imo"

Within Kokanu communities, $hon $kanisa $mi is quite a common expression. It it sometimes, when it makes sense in context, shortened to $hon $mi (lit. "as for me").

**hon** $te $kota $tuntan $je Kokanu, $men $tu $o $teka $in $ne $pata $ikasi. - Roughly, "On the topic of Kokanu grammar, read this guide." (lit. "In the context of speaking Kokanu correctly, you should read this learning document")

**hon** $lantan $te $hunsi $matin, $men $mi $le $lun $nile $in $ja - "About the car that was red, I am making it blue"

### Conditionals

When providing a subordinate clause as context, it is usually interpreted as saying "given that". However, if the hypotheticality marker $kate is used, or in certain contexts, it is interpreted as a conditional. $kate is nearly always needed if the situation is hypothetical.

**hon** $ta $lantan $le $hunsi $kate, $men $mi $le $lun $nile $in $ja - "If the car is red, I will make it blue"

The tense of this sentence is unspecified, and the $hon statement is more saying that in any context where the statement is true, the action will be performed. If you're referring to a specific situation, it's more common to say:<br>
**pi** $ta $lantan $le $hunsi, $men $mi $le $lun $nile $in $ja - "When the car is red, I will paint it blue"

Whether or not this statement is hypotethetical is ambiguous and up to context.

If you want to say *given* something, you would use $hon without $kate.

**hon** $ta $lantan $le $hunsi, $men $mi $le $lun $nile $in $ja - "Given that the car is red, I will make it blue"

Keep in mind that this statement could be in any tense. It could be "Given that the car was red, I made it blue", or "Given that the car will be red, I will make it blue".

### Examples

**hon** $ta $tu $le $ju $kate $te $lo $ki $insu $je $makan,, $men $mi $le $ju $te $lo $kan $tu - "If you want go to the restaurant, then I want to go with you"<br>
**hon** $ta $na $le $sankan $men $lan $mi $o $kosan $in $pan $tuntan $te $po $na $pan $katin - "Given that that's important, we should create a solution for that problem"<br>
$Inkilisi $le $katin **hon** $nin $Nihon - "English is hard for Japanese people"<br>
**hon** $ten $nelo $melon $men $mi $le $ju $konen $te $no $lo $ki $jan $enteken - "Tonight I'll probably not want to go the park"
