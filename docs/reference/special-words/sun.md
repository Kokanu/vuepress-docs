# sun

The preposition $sun marks the **origin** or **source**, roughly equivalent to "from", or "since" (i.e. "I have been busy since 18:00")

$mi $le $lo **sun** $insu $mi. - "I am leaving my house"

$mi $le $alu $matin **sun** $tu $in $kuwosi. - "I received a fruit from you"

$na $makan $le $sun $Kanse. - "That food is from France"

$sun can also mark **replication** in certain contexts.

$mi $le $tasuwi $sun $na $pawo. - I draw from that dog

Be careful when using $sun in this way however, as the default interpretation of $sun is with its origin or source meaning.

$mi $le $kosan $in $ne $sun $ne $insu, can mean both "I built that using this building as a reference" *and* "I built that starting from this building" (in terms of location). Make sure it's clear which term you're using.

But you can always add $teka $je to make it clear that you mean in terms of from its view.

$mi $le $kosan $in $ne $sun $teka $je $na $insu. - "I built this from the sight of that building"
