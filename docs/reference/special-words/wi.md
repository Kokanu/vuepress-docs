# wi

$wi is a derivational marker that forces words into base modifiers. This means that it can take a phrase, and turn it into a base modifier. The phrase takes on whatever meaning it has when it's meant as a modifier.

This means that when using $wi on a verb (e.g. "wi makan"), the phrase "wi \<verb\>" will be a base modifier with the meaning of whatever the verb means in its modifier form.
So for example, $makan in its modifier form means "food-like/edible". If $wi were to be used with it, it would turn into $wi $makan.

Here are a few more examples, with their original meaning, and then their new meanings when used in different places in combination with $wi.

| Word | Original meaning | Original modifier meaning | New noun meaning | New verb meaning | New modifier meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| makan | to eat (food) | edible/food-like | edibility/food-like-ness | to be edible/food-like | edible/food-like |
| teka | to see (a sight) | visible/sight-like | visbility/sight-like-ness | to be visible/sight-like | visible/sight-like |
| onton | to wear (clothing) | wearable/clothing-like | wearability/clothing-like-ness | to be wearable/clothing-like | wearable-clothing-like |

Due to how $wi functions, when it is used with a base modifier, it has no effect. $wi converts the base modifier into a base modifier meaning the modifier meaning of the base modifier, so it literally converts it to itself. So the two phrases "tope" and "wi tope" are indentical.

This, however, does not mean that $wi is useless with base modifiers. Most obviously, in order to negate a modifier, you'd say $wi $no \<modifier\>.
So in order to say "not good", you would say "wi no tope". $wi is required here because $no does not negate any words itself, but rather negates the grammatical particle behind it.

There is another way $wi can be used, and that is in that it can be used to apply modifiers to modifiers.
