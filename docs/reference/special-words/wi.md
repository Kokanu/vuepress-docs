# wi

$wi is a derivational marker that forces words into base modifiers. This means that it can take a phrase, and turn it into a base modifier. The phrase takes on whatever meaning it has when it's meant as a modifier.

This means that when using $wi on a verb (e.g. "wi makan"), the phrase "wi \<verb\>" will be a base modifier with the meaning of whatever the verb means in its modifier form.

So for example, $makan in its modifier form means "food-like/edible". If $wi were to be used with it, it would turn into $wi $makan.

Here are a few more examples, with their original meaning, and then their new meanings when used in different places in combination with $wi.

| Word | Original meaning | Original modifier meaning | New noun meaning | New verb meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| makan | to eat (food) | edible/food-like | edibility/food-like-ness | to be edible/food-like |
| teka | to see (a sight) | visible/sight-like | visbility/sight-like-ness | to be visible/sight-like |
| onton | to wear (clothing) | wearable/clothing-like | wearability/clothing-like-ness | to be wearable/clothing-like |

Due to how $wi functions, when it is used with a base modifier, it has no effect. $wi converts the base modifier into a base modifier that means the modifier meaning of the base modifier, so it literally converts it to itself. So the two phrases "tope" and "wi tope" are indentical.

This, however, does not mean that $wi is useless with base modifiers. Most obviously, because in order to negate a modifier, you'd have to say $wi $no \<modifier\>.

So in order to say "not good", you would say $wi $no $tope. $wi is required here because $no does not negate any words itself, but rather negates the grammatical particle behind it.

But there is reason why $wi is used with base modifiers, and that is because it can be used to apply modifiers to modifiers (i.e. adverbs).

### wi and Adverbs

This topic is already explained in the [clarifying descriptions](./../clarifying-descriptions.md) section, however, to give a quick summary, $je is a word that roughly translates to "of" in English, and is used as the genitive particle.

However, $je can also be used to apply modifications to adverbs. If you were to say something is "very good", you could say it was $je $tope $lan (of much goodness).

But because anything after $je is automatically a noun, this can feel a bit clunky for a lot of speakers, and so another way to say "very good" arose:<br>
$wi $tope $lan

(It should be noted that both $je and $wi are correct in this context, and either can be used)

When using $wi, the head modifier, that being the modifier that comes directly after $wi, is modified by any modifiers that come after it.

This means that saying $wi $tope $canu $tason means "plannable coldly good". I don't know what that means either but the grammar holds up either way.

This not only allows modifiers to become adverbs that modify modifiers, but it also allows quantity words to describe the intensity of adjectives:

| ɕı ʌʃʜȷ ɞȷɤȷ | wi tope mese | more good / better |
| ɕı ʌʃʜȷ oƨı | wi tope ani | most good / best |

$matuwa **$wi $kusa $jati** $le $kota $ta $ja $le $cuma $ki $nin $sone - "The annoyed parent said their goodbyes to the other person"
$in $husu $je $ta $ka $na $nin $le $wisan $in $sin **$wi $joli $ani**, $men $non $je $pan $pucon $le $kota - "The council discussed whether or not that person knew what was most beneficial"
$sin **$wi $sankan $mese** $le $ta $ja $le $ALU $IN $ANI $JE $MANI $MI!! - "The more important thing is that he TOOK ALL OF MY MONEY!!"

In order to specify that something coming after $wi isn't part of the $wi clause, $wa can be placed for the phrase to collapse it. This is fully described in [clarifying descriptions](./../clarifying-descriptions.md), so this will not be explained again here. The collapsing works exactly the same as it would for $je
