# so

The grammar particle **so** means "than", "as", or "compared to".

Comparison
----------

When used with $mese and $menu it creates **comparatives**. Comparatives are phrases like "bigger than", "less cold than", etc., stating **relative** comparisons between things.

$pawo $tu $le $cenpo $mese **so** $pawo $mi. - "Your dog is **bigger than** my dog"

$mi $le $ju $mese $te $makan, **so** $te $antomi. - "I would rather eat than sleep", literally "I want more to eat than to sleep"

Equality/Similiarity
--------------------

Another use of **so** is with $saman “equal/same” and $sone “different” to talk about similarity. This can be combined with $cimi (specific) and $ema (vague) to differentiate between things being exactly the same or just similar. Without them, the degree of similarity is implied through context, as is true of much of Kokanu.

$na $le $saman **so** $ne. - "That is the **same as** this"

$na $le **$sone $lan so** $ne. - "That is **very different than** this"

$na $pawo $le $se $teka $wi **$saman $cimi** $so $pawo $mi. - "That dog looks **exactly like** mine"

$tu **so** $ja $le $se $teka $wi $saman $ema $la! - "You and him look **kinda similar**!"

Superlatives
------------

Unlike comparatives, **superlatives** state **absolute** comparisons: "best", "most enjoyable", "fastest". For this, you can use the phrase $mese $so $ani, meaning "more than all", or use $ani as a modifier.

"I am the fastest person" can be translated either as:

$mi $le $nin $te **$wiki** $mese **so $ani**. - "I am the **fastest** person", literally "I am the person that is **faster than all**"

or

$mi $le $nin $wi **wiki ani**. "I am the fastest person", literally "I am the utmost fast person"

"I ate the most" can be translated either as:

$mi $le $makan $matin $mese **so $ani**. - "I ate **the most**"

or

$mi $le $makan $matin $je $mita $ani. - "I ate **the most**", literally "I ate of the utmost amount"

Using $ani as a modifier is the more common translation, however both are correct.

This can also be extended to $menu $so $ani, meaning "less than all", to communicate superlatives of inferiority.

Examples
-------------

$mi $le $wisan $mese $so $ani $wala $mi. - "I know more than my siblings"

$ja $le $tope $so $na $mu $loso. - "It's better than *that* bad thing"

$so $hen $nanku $mani $men $hen $san $le $no $lan. - "Compared to ten thousand dollars, one thousand isn't a lot'"
