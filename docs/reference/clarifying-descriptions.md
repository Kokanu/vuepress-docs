# Clarifying Descriptions

To describe **nouns** and **verbs**, we use words tacked on to the right of a head word (the root or main content word, either noun or verb), these words are called **modifiers**. Read this guide to learn more about how modifiers can be understood and also how to make use of two helpful prepositional markers **je** and **wa**.

You can use any word as a modifier and when it's tacked onto a head word, it means that the **modifier** word is an _attribute_ of the head word. In other words, the head word now has some kind of relation to the modifier. 

> All content words can be used as modifiers. Check out our [Word Derivations](./word-derivations.md) guide for more info.

Modifiers can affect other modified phrases, connecting together to form modifier chains. When modifiers are chained, each modifier affects the head **noun**/**verb** and all of the **modifiers** that have already been associated with that head **noun**/**verb**. The combination of the head **noun**/**verb** plus all chained modifiers is known as a **phrase** (**noun phrase** or a **verb** **phrase**).

$pawo **$cenpo** **$mi** $le $tope.<br>
"**My** **big** dog is good."
  
> ((pawo cenpo) mi) le tope.

**Noun phrase**: *pawo cenpo mi*

$in $makan $satu $canu $cenpo $le $makan.<br>
"A **large** **ice** cream is eaten."  

> in (((makan satu) canu) lan) le makan.

**Noun phrase**: *makan satu canu cenpo*

Modifiers chain together and are attributes for the **entire preceding phrase**, not just the previous modifier. *satu* applies to *makan*, *canu* applies to *makan **satu***, so now *cenpo* applies to the entire phrase *makan satu canu*, not just to *canu*.

So how would you instead say "a _very cold_ candy"? For that, we need to _regroup_ the modifiers using the **genitive preposition** marker $je.

### Genitive Preposition

The **preposition** marker je is used for **genitive** relationships. Think of the **genitive** as relating one thing as an attribute to another. The best equivalence in English is the word "of". The words that are directly after the marker are a new **noun phrase** that is some kind of attribute of the **noun phrase** directly preceding the marker.  For this reason, the **genitive** **preposition** marker is also considered a **regrouping** marker.

$nin $tope $lan - "many good people"  
  
$nin $je $tope $lan - literally "person (or people) of much goodness", or "a very good person"

By using $je, the word $tope becomes a **head** **noun** meaning _goodness_ which now begins a new **noun phrase** which is further modified by $lan. This new **noun phrase** (_much goodness_) is now an attribute of the preceding **noun phrase** (_person_).

### Kinds of Genitive Attribution

Using the genitive preposition marker is also good for creating many different relationships between two **noun phrases**. What these relationships are differs depending on the context and the words chosen. All of the below genitive relationships were gathered from various forms of genitive attribution from around the world. Not every example is directly translated into English and often English makes use of alternative prepositions like "with", "by", and "for". Kokanu only has those kinds of prepositions attached to a main or subordinate clause of a sentence (essentially, they must be tied to a verb). But equipped with the simple $je preposition, context and supporting word choices, you can effectively communicate all of these genitive relations. If after all of that, your listener/reader still does not understand, you can make use of clarifying words to clarify the specific meaning you were trying to achieve.

#### Descriptive Genitive

Specifies some detail of the preceding phrase. "described by" or "characterized by" are equivalent English expressions. This is a catch-all genitive for when the attribution is ambiguous.

$pata $je $pa $enteken $hunsi "book characterized by a red cover" (lit. document of red cover)

You can clarify that a genitive relationship is descriptive by using $kun:

$pata $je $kun $je $pa $enteken $hunsi (lit. document of quality of red cover)

#### Possessive Genitive

Specifies the preceding phrase as being owned or possessed by the attached genitive phrase. "belonging to" or "possessed by" are English equivalents.

$mu $sema $je $canwa "ear belonging to an animal" (lit. ear of animal)

You can clarify that a genitive relationship is descriptive by using $han:

$mu $sema $je $han $je $canwa (lit. ear of possession of animal)

#### Familial Genitive

Specifies the preceding phrase as having a familial relationship with the attached genitive phrase. "related to" is an equivalent English expression. This is considered a subset of Possessive Genitive.

$matuwa $je $matuwa $mi "mother related to my mother" (lit. mother of my mother)

You can clarify a genitive relationship is familial by using $lije:

$matuwa $je $lije $je $matuwa $mi (lit. mother of relation of my mother)

#### Partitive Genitive

Specifies the preceding phrase as being part of some larger whole or set. "Which is part of" is an equivalent expression in English. Sometimes the preceding phrase only contains a quantity word or $osa.

$jati $je $makan "some which is part of the food" (lit. some of food)  
  
$osa $wan $je $ha "first part which is part of two" (lit. first part of two)

You can clarify a genitive relationship is partitive by using $osa:

$jati ($je) $osa $je $makan (lit. some of parts of food)

#### Attributive Genitive

Specifies the attached genitive phrase as being an attribute or innate quality of the preceding phrase. Semantically similar to regular modifier usage but more emphatic in its attribution.

$insu $je $hela "sacred building" (lit. building of sacredness) 

You can clarify a genitive relationship is attributive by using $kun alone or $han and $kun:

$insu $je $han $je $kun $je $hela (lit. building of possession of quality of sacredness)

#### Attributed Genitive

Specifies the preceding phrase as being an attribute or innate quality of the attached genitive phrase. "attributed to" or "is an attribute of" are equivalent English expressions. The opposite of Attributive Genitive. The preceding phrase must be a concept that can be considered an attribute and the attached genitive phrase must be a thing that can be attributed (and specifically can be attributed the thing that is the preceding phrase).

$je $niku "weakness attributed to muscles" (lit. weakness of muscles)

You could clarify this genitive relationship using $sanpanti again although some directional ambiguity would remain:

$je $sanpanti $je $niku (lit. weakness of relation of muscles)

You could clarify this genitive relationship using $kun again although some directional ambiguity would remain:

$je $kun $je $niku (lit. weakness of quality of muscles)

You could clarify this genitive relationship using se $limijen:

$je $se $limijen $je $niku (lit. weakness of inner existence of muscles)

#### Genitive of Material

Specifies the preceding phrase as being made of a material. "made out of" or "consisting of" are equivalent English expressions.

$lantan $je $namu $kijeta "vehicle made out of hard wood" (lit. vehicle of hard wood)

You can clarify a genitive relationship is material by using $niju:

$lantan $je $niju $je $namu $kijeta (lit. vehicle of material of hard wood)

#### Genitive of Content

Specifies the preceding phrase as containing within itself the attached genitive phrase. "full of" or "containing" or equivalent English expressions. Similar to the Material Genitive but the contents are a separate entity from the material of the container.

$non $pani $je $micin "lake containing fish" (lit. water body of fish)

You can clarify a genitive relationship is material by using $han $limijen:

$non $pani $je $han $limijen $je $micin (lit. water body of inner possession of fish)

#### Epexegetical Genitive

Specifies the attached genitive phrase as being another separate way to to explain the preceding phrase. "which is", "that is", "namely", "who is" are equivalent English expressions.

$tene $je $makan "gift which is food" (lit. gift of food)

You can clarify this genitive relationship by using a subordinate clause in the attached genitive phrase:

$nin Alese $je $te $nin $suki $je $mi "Alice, which is a friend of mine" (lit. person Alice of which they are a likable person of me)

#### Genitive of Destination/Purpose

Specifies the destination or purpose that the preceding phrase is leading to. "for the purpose of", "destined for", "towards", "into" are equivalent English expressions.

$pata $je $nin $neso "children's books" (lit. documents of young people)

You can clarify this genitive relationship by using a subordinate clause with an inner po clause:

$pata $je $te $po $nin $neso (lit. document that is existing for young people)

#### Genitive of Production

Specifies that the preceding phrase is made by the attached genitive phrase. "produced by" is an equivalent English expression.

$umo $je $makan $tuko "steam produced by the hot food" (lit. smoke/cloud of hot food)

$tasuwi $lo $je $osole "movie which produces fear" (lit. moving picture of fear)

You can clarify that a genitive relationship is Product by using $mu $pon:

$tasuwi $lo $je $mu $pon $je $osole (lit. moving picture of causer of fear)

#### Genitive of Separation

Specifies that the preceding phrase is separate from the attached genitive phrase. "out of", "away from" ,or simply "from" are equivalent English expressions.

$tula $tula $je $ja "far from them" (lit. far distance of them)  
  
$lipan $je $ukama $honja "clear from wild plants" (lit. absence of wild plants)

You can clarify that a genitive relationship is Separation by using a subordinate clause with pijen and $sun:

$lipan $je $te $pijen $sun $ukama $honja (lit. absence of which is becoming from wild plants)

#### Genitive of Source

Specifies the origin of the preceding phrase. "out of", "derived from", "dependent on" are equivalent English expressions. This genitive can often be bettered expressed using the $sun thematic role marker.

$pani $nase $hunsi $je $pumi Chanpen "wine out of Champagne" (lit. red intoxicated liquid of land Champagne)  
  
$namu $je $insu $cune "wood derived from the old building" (lit. wood of old building)

You can clarify that a genitive relationship is Source by using a subordinate clause with se and $sun:

$namu $je $te $sun $insu $cune (lit. wood of which is from old building)

#### Genitive of Price/Value

Specifies the price or value of the preceding phrase. "for", "worth" are an equivalent English expressions. The attached genitive phrase must contain concepts of money, value or amount.

$makan $satu $je $ha $mani "candy for two dollars" (lit. sweet food of two monies)  
  
$san $neje $je $tiju $jone "three horses worth ten goats" (lit. three horses of ten goats)

You can clarify that a genitive relationship is Price/Value by using $mita:

$san $neje $je $mita $je $tiju $jone (lit. three horses of value of ten goats)

#### Genitive of Time

Specifies the time or duration of the preceding phrase. "during", "at", "within", "for" are equivalent English expressions. The attached genitive phrase must contain concepts of time or duration.

You can also clarify this relationship using a subordinate clause and an:

$lo $je $te $an $nelo $osa $je $kin (lit. movement of which is at the dark part of day)

#### Genitive of Place

Specifies a vague local relation to the preceding phrase. "in", "at", "through", "over" are equivalent English expressions. The attached genitive phrase must contain concepts of location. Often uses the words opotu or sekano.

$niwa $je $honja "cabin in the woods" (lit. residence of the wilderness)  
  
$mi $le $lo $je $pumi $pani $ki $sinsi "I travel through the marsh to the city" (lit. I am moving of wet land to the city)

You can clarify that a genitive relationship is Place by using $jan:

$niwa $je $jan $je $honja (lit. residence of place of wilderness)

You can also clarify this relationship using a subordinate clause and an:

$niwa $je $te $an $honja (lit. residence of which is at the wilderness)

#### Genitive of Means

Specifies the manner of the preceding phrase. "by", "by means of" are equivalent English expressions. This genitive can often be better expressed using the $wija thematic role marker.

$pilu $je $tun $katin "achievement by hard work" (lit. victory of hard work)

You can clarify this relationship using a subordinate clause and $wija:

$pilu $je $te $wija $tun $katin (lit. victory of which is by means of hard work)

#### Genitive of Agency

Specifies the agent that is engaged with the preceding phrase. "by", "by means of" are equivalent English expressions. The attached genitive phrase must contain a person or other active entity to be seen as this type of genitive and often can be easily misconstrued as a Possessive Genitive.

$tun $takaha $je $hoton $cenpo $nelo "attack by means of a black bear" (lit. violent action of a black large mammal)

You can clarify this relationship using a subordinate clause and $wija:

$tun $takaha $je $te $wija $hoton $cenpo $nelo (lit. violent action of which is by means of black large mammal)

#### Genitive of Reference

Specifies a reference entity that helps better explain the preceding phrase. "with reference to" or "with respect to" are equivalent English expressions. This genitive can often be bettered expressed using the so thematic role marker.

$mese $ten $je $tun $mi $te $pijen $te $pen "more time with respect to my studies" (lit. more time of my work of coming to understand)

You can clarify this relationship using a subordinate clause and so:

$mese $ten $te $pen $so $ten $je $tun $sone (lit. more studying time compared to time of other actions)

#### Subjective Genitive

Specifies or describes the subject of the preceding phrase when the preceding phrase is a verb phrase or a noun phrase that contains an action.  This genitive can always be converted into a sentence where the genitive noun phrase is the subject of the action. Some constructions could either be subjective or objective genitive but context can help identify the appropriate type.

$kota $je $nin $mu $hapijo "speech of the announcer" (lit. speech of the announcer person)  
  
$lo $je $micin $cenpo "movement of whales" (lit. movement of big sea creatures)

You can clarify this genitive relationship by replacing the whole relation with a subordinate noun clause while describing the subject:

$ta $micin $cenpo $le $lo, ... (lit. big sea creatures which are moving)

You can also clarify this genitive relationship with $pon:

$lo $je $pon $je $micin $cenpo (lit. movement of result of big sea creatures)

#### Objective Genitive

Specifies or describes the object of the preceding phrase when the preceding phrase is a transitive verb phrase or a noun phrase that contains a transitive action. "for", "about", "concerning", "towards", "against" are English equivalent expressions. This genitive can always be converted into a sentence where the genitive noun phrase is the object of the action.

$mi $le $kota $je $meja "we talked about cats" (lit. we talked of cats)  
  
$sinsi $mi $le $kela $je $sinsi $sone "my city played against the other city" (lit. my city played of different city)

You can clarify this genitive relationship by replacing the whole relation with a subordinate noun clause while describing the object:

$mi $le $kota $in $sin $je $meja (lit. we said things of cats)  
  
$sinsi $mi $le $kela $in $te $kela $wija $sinsi $sone (lit. my city played a playing by means of different city)

#### Plenary Genitive

Specifies or describes the subject _and_ object of the preceding phrase when the preceding phrase is a verb phrase or a noun phrase that contains an action. Both subjective and objective genitive forms fit and the meanings should not contract but instead complement each other.

$te $amo, $je $Ocota "love of God" (lit. loving of God)

You can clarify this genitive relationship by replacing the whole relation with a subordinate noun clause and usen:

$mi $un $Ocota $le $amo $in $usen (lit. I and God love each other)

* * *

### Chains of je

Unlike modifiers, a noun phrase containing multiple genitive prepositional markers do not chain onto each other from _left to right_. It is considered an _immediate_ relationship between the two noun phrases on either side of the marker and so chaining occurs from _right to left_ with each successive completed je-phrase being attached to the noun or $je within the outer phrase (to the left).

$niwa $je $matuwa $je $matuwa $mi - "My grandparent's house", grouped as "(house of (the parent of my parent))"  
  
$pawo $je $wala $je $matuwa $je $matuwa $mi \- "My great-aunt's dog", grouped as "(dog of (the sibling of (the parent of my parent)))"  
  
$jan $je $insu $je $makan - "restaurant location", grouped as "(place of (the house of food))"

When using je after a verb, the je\-phrase acts like an **adverbial phrase**, just like any other modifier would on a verb. Adverbial phrases can be used to describe several different genitive relationships.

$mi $le $kota $je $sema $lan - "I talk **loudly**", literally "I talk **of much volume**"

Due to context playing a major part in our understanding of Kokanu sentences, this sentence wouldn't be perceived as saying "I talk **about** much volume". The phrase "of much volume" describes **the manner in which the talking occurs**. This attached genitive phrase describes something that would typically be construed as being a detail of manner (Genitive of Means) instead of discussion material (Objective Genitive). If you want to clarify that you are talking "about" something, you can use the verb husu:

$mi $le $kota $je $husu $je $sema $lan (lit. I talk of concern of much volume)

### Collapsing Noun Phrases

The way je chains isn't an issue for the statement $niwa $je $matuwa $je $matuwa $mi, as it still translates to a phrase that roughly means "my grandparent's house", however there are some cases where it can cause issues.

$insu $je $makan - "restaurant"  
  
$jan $je $kawa - "bathroom"  
  
$jan $je $kawa $je $insu $je $makan - "place of restaurant garbage"...?

Grouped as "place of (dirtiness of (building of food))"

There's another preposition marker called the noun phrase collapsing preposition marker ( $wa ). It can be used to resolve this problem. $wa _collapses_ the part of a noun phrase before it and treats it as if it is one complete noun phrase.

There are a few rules that you must understand to make proper usage of wa:

*   A content word directly after $wa is to be interpreted as a **modifier**, not a **noun**.
*   A $ta / $te clause directly after $wa is to be interpreted as a **relative clause**, not a **subordinate clause**.
*   It causes the **modifier** (or chain) or **relative clause** after it to act on all (or any amount) of the previous elements of the chain before it.
*   The two markers can be combined as $wa $je and be used to have a content word in its **noun** form act on the whole of the chain before it.
*   This marker _does not regroup_ like the genitive preposition marker.
*   You cannot negate a wa particle just as you cannot insert negations inside of a modifier chain.

$jan $je $kawa $wa $je $insu $je $makan - "restaurant bathroom" ((place of dirtiness) of (building of food))

Here's a larger example of this interplay between the two particles.

1. $insu $je $makan $wa $cenpo $hunsi $je $tope $lan $wa $ta $mi $le $suki $in \$ $ja \ $je $makan 'restaurant' (lit. place of food)
2.  $insu $je $makan $wa, for the sake of the words after it, can be thought of as insu-je-makan-wa
3.  $insu $je $makan $wa $cenpo 'big restaurant', as $cenpo _sees_ insu-je-makan-wa  
    **Note:** $insu $je $makan $cenpo is 'place of big food', which is not the same
4.  $insu $je $makan $wa $cenpo $hunsi 'red big restaurant', as $hunsi _sees_ insu-je-makan-wa $cenpo
5.  $insu $je $makan $wa $cenpo $hunsi $je $tope $lan 'very-good red big restaurant', as $je $tope $lan _sees_ insu-je-makan-wa $cenpo $hunsi and acts on all of it because from its perspective, it's only acting on one chain (like how $je $tope $lan would also act on meja $cenpo $hunsi as that is only one chain)
6.  $insu $je $makan $wa $cenpo $hunsi $je $tope $lan $wa, for the sake of the words after it, can be thought of as insu-je-makan-wa-cenpo-hunsi-je-tope-lan-wa
7.  $insu $je $makan $wa $cenpo $hunsi $je $tope $lan $wa $ta $mi $le $suki $in \$ $ja \ $mi $le $suki $in \$ [ja \] _sees_ insu-je-makan-wa-cenpo-hunsi-je-tope-lan-wa
