# Basic Grammar

::: warning
This documentation may be incomplete, broken or inaccurate.
:::

The essential details to get a grasp on Kokanu grammar and start exploring how to express yourself and communicate. The coverage is very fast paced and minimally detailed, more detailed articles are linked if you want to expand your knowledge of a given area.

This guide assumes you have some familiarity with the Kokanu vocabulary. Words that directly affect the grammar are explained here in the guide, but other words used in the example sentences will not. You can **click** on any described Kokanu word to see a definition of that word, and you can look up other words using the [dictionary](https://dictionary.kokanu.com/).

Base Forms
----------

Every word has one base form, either base **noun**, base **verb**, or base **modifier**. Any word can act in any form, but its base determines how it acts in other forms. You can always distinguish when a word is being used as a **noun**, **verb** or **modifier**.

Verbs are marked by the particles $le and $o.

|Likanu|Latin script|English|
|-|-|-|
| [ɞ̄ȷ ɞı]{.red} [ʋȷ ɞx̄]{.green}: | [men mi]{.red} [le makan]{.green}.<br> | [I]{.red} [eat]{.green}. |

**Nouns** are marked by the **prepositions**, like $men, $in, $ki, and $wija.

|Likanu|Latin script|English|
|-|-|-|
| [ɞ̄ȷ ɞı]{.red} [ʋȷ ɞx̄]{.green} **ōı ɞx̄**{.blue}: | [men mi]{.red} [le makan]{.green} **in makan**{.blue}. | [I]{.red} [eat]{.green} **food**{.blue}. |

**Modifiers** are activated when placed after a **noun** or **verb**.

|Likanu|Latin script|English|
|-|-|-|
| [ɞ̄ȷ ɞı]{.red} [ʋȷ ɞx̄]{.green} **ɕıxı**{.yellow} [ōı xſɕʃɤı]{.blue} **ɞx̄**{.magenta}: | [men mi]{.red} [le makan]{.green} **wiki**{.yellow} [in kuwosi]{.blue} **makan**{.magenta}. | [I]{.red} **quickly**{.yellow} [eat]{.green} an **edible**{.magenta} [fruit]{.blue}. |

### Relations between action and noun phrases

The structure of a Kokanu sentence is formed from an **action phrase**, marked by $le or $o, surrounded by **noun phrases** which relate to the action in some way. $men marks a **noun phrase** which is the **agent** of the action. $in marks a **noun phrase** which is the object of the action. $ki marks a **noun phrase** which is the recipient of the action. $wija marks a **noun phrase** which is the instrument of the action. The **action phrases** and **noun phrases** can be placed in any order as long as they are marked properly.

|Likanu|Latin script|English|
|-|-|-|
| [ɕıɂ ɞʃʌʃ]{.yellow} [ōı ɞx̄]{.blue} [ʋȷ ʋ̄ſ ʌɂʋı]{.green} [ɞ̄ȷ ɞı]{.red}: | [wija moto]{.yellow} [in makan]{.blue} [le lun tajali]{.green} [men mi]{.red}. | [I]{.red} [prepare]{.green} [food]{.blue} [using fire]{.yellow}. / [I]{.red} [cook]{.green} [food]{.blue}. |

When the subject is at the _start_ of a sentence, however, $men can be dropped.

|Likanu|Latin script|
|-|-|
| [ɞ̄ȷ ɞı]{.red} [ʋȷ ɞx̄]{.green}: | [men mi]{.red} [le makan]{.green}. |
| [ɞı]{.red} [ʋȷ ɞx̄]{.green}: | [mi]{.red} [le makan]{.green}. |

**Prepositions**, $le, and $o can be negated by placing $no after them. $no can also be used to negate specific attributes when combined with particles, which will be explained later.

These three sentences mean the same thing but have different emphasis:

|Likanu|Latin script|English|
|-|-|-|
| [ɞı]{.red} **ʋȷ**{.green} **ƨʃ**{.yellow} **ɞx̄**{.green} [ōı xſɕʃɤı]{.blue}: | [mi]{.red} **le**{.green} **no**{.yellow} **makan**{.green} [in kuwosi]{.blue}. | [I]{.red} **don’t**{.yellow} **eat**{.green} [fruit]{.blue}. (but I may do something else to it) |
| [ɞı]{.red} [ʋȷ ɞx̄]{.green} **ōı**{.blue} **ƨʃ**{.yellow} **xſɕʃɤı**{.blue}: | [mi]{.red} [le makan]{.green} **in**{.blue} **no**{.yellow} **kuwosi**{.blue}. | [I]{.red} **don’t**{.yellow} [eat]{.green} **fruit**{.blue}. (but I may eat something else) | 
| **ɞ̄ȷ**{.red} **ƨʃ**{.yellow} **ɞı**{.red} [ʋȷ ɞx̄]{.green} [ōı xſɕʃɤı]{.blue}: | **men**{.red} **no**{.yellow} **mi**{.red} [le makan]{.green} [in kuwosi]{.blue}. | **I**{.red} **don’t**{.yellow} [eat]{.green} [fruit]{.blue}. (but someone/thing else may) |

Conjunctions in Kokanu can be placed between nouns in a phrase, or between sentences.

However, "un", meaning "and", is not required like it is in English. In phrases where two nouns of the same function are next to each other, (e.g. me **and** you go to the park) "un" may be used on its own, the preposition may be repeated, or both strategies may be combined. "un" may still be used to connect sentences together like in English.

|Likanu|Latin script|English|
|-|-|-|
| [ɞı]{.red} [ʋȷ ɞx̄]{.green} [ōı xſɕʃɤı]{.blue} **ōſ**{.yellow} [oſxɞ]{.blue}: | [mi]{.red} [le makan]{.green} [in kuwosi]{.blue} **un**{.yellow} [ukama]{.blue}. | [I]{.red} [eat]{.green} [fruits]{.blue} **and**{.yellow} [vegetables]{.blue}. |
| [ɞı]{.red} [ʋȷ ɞx̄]{.green} [ōı xſɕʃɤı **ōı** oſxɞ]{.blue}: | [mi]{.red} [le makan]{.green} [in kuwosi **in** ukama]{.blue}. | [I]{.red} [eat]{.green} [fruits **and** vegetables]{.blue}. |
| [ɞı]{.red} [ʋȷ ɞx̄]{.green} [ōı xſɕʃɤı]{.blue} [**ōſ**]{.yellow} [**ōı** oſxɞ]{.blue}: | [mi]{.red} [le makan]{.green} [in kuwosi]{.blue} **un**{.yellow} [**in** ukama]{.blue}. | [I]{.red} [eat]{.green} [fruits]{.blue} **and**{.yellow} [vegetables]{.blue}. |
| [ɞı]{.red} [ʋȷ ɞx̄]{.green} [ōı xſɕʃɤı]{.blue} **ōſ**{.yellow} [ɞı]{.red} [ʋȷ ʋʃ]{.green} [ɤ̄ſ ƨȷ ɂ̄]{.magenta}: | [mi]{.red} [le makan]{.green} [in kuwosi]{.blue} **un**{.yellow} [mi]{.red} [le lo]{.green} [sun ne jan]{.magenta}. | [I]{.red} [eat]{.green} [fruits]{.blue} **and**{.yellow} [I]{.red} [move]{.green} ([from this place]{.magenta}). |

An imperative statement is created by replacing $le with $o. When there is a subject in the phrase, the phrase is interpreted as a suggestion, however if the subject is dropped, the phrase is interpreted as a command.

|Likanu|Latin script|English|
|-|-|-|
| [ʌſ]{.red} [ʋȷ ʋʃ]{.green}: | [tu]{.red} [le lo]{.green}. | [You]{.red} [move]{.green}. |
| [ʌſ]{.red} [oʃ ʋʃ]{.green}ʭ | [tu]{.red} [o lo]{.green}! | [You]{.red} [should move]{.green}! |
| [oʃ ʋʃ]{.green}ʭ | [o lo]{.green}! | [Move]{.green}! |

### Relations between words within phrases

**Modifiers** come after a **noun** to indicate an **adjective**, or after a **verb** to indicate an **adverb**. **Quantity words** serve ordinary functions as **modifiers**, but have an additional quantity function when _preceding_ a word. All numbers are ordinals when placed after a noun, but are cardinals when placed before.

|Likanu|Latin script|English|
|------|------------|-------|
| xſɕʃɤı [ɕ̄]{.yellow} | kuwosi [wan]{.yellow} | [first]{.yellow} fruit |
| [ɕ̄]{.yellow} xſɕʃɤı | [wan]{.yellow} kuwosi | [one]{.yellow} fruit |
| ʌʃʜȷ [ʋ̄]{.yellow} | tope [lan]{.yellow} | [very]{.yellow} good |
| [ʋ̄]{.yellow} ʌʃʜȷ | [lan]{.yellow} tope | [several]{.yellow} goodnesses |
| [ʋ̄]{.yellow} ɞı | [lan]{.yellow} mi | we |

The word $je is similar to the word “of” in English. The word following it is always derived as a **noun**.

|Likanu|Latin script|English|
|------|------------|-------|
| ʌıʜ [ɞx̄]{.yellow} | tipa [makan]{.yellow} | [edible]{.yellow} box
| ʌıʜ [ɂȷ]{.magenta} [ɞx̄]{.yellow} | tipa [je]{.magenta} [makan]{.yellow} | [food]{.yellow} box, [lunch]{.yellow}box |
| xſɕʃɤı [ɵ]{.yellow} [ɞı]{.magenta} | kuwosi [ha]{.yellow} [mi]{.magenta} | [my]{.magenta} [second]{.yellow} fruit |
| xſɕʃɤı [ɂȷ]{.green} [ɵ]{.yellow} [ɞı]{.magenta} | kuwosi [je]{.green} [ha]{.yellow} [mi]{.magenta} | [us]{.magenta} [two]{.yellow}[’s]{.green} fruit |

The word $wa marks a **modifier** without any **noun** or **verb** needing to precede it, and applies to the entire phrase before it.

|Likanu|Latin script|English|
|------|------------|-------|
|xſɕʃɤı [ɂȷ]{.green} [ɵ ɞı]{.yellow} [ɕ]{.magenta} [ɵ̄ſɤı]{.red} | kuwosi [je]{.green} [ha mi]{.yellow} [wa]{.magenta} [hunsi]{.red} | [us two]{.yellow}[’s]{.green} [red]{.red} fruit |

### Relations between clauses within phrases

$ta starts a new clause (sentence within a sentence), while $te starts a new clause and marks the first word as a **verb**. The $te clause can modify a noun, and in these cases the noun being modified is the **subject** of the clause.

|Likanu|Latin script|English|
|-|-|-|
| ƨ̄ı [ʌȷ]{.yellow} [ɞx̄]{.green} | nin [te]{.yellow} [makan]{.green} | person [who]{.yellow} [eats]{.green} |

$te can also be used without modifying a noun to create a clause that **starts with a verb** anywhere in a sentence, but the clause must end with a comma if more comes after it. This construction is used similar to how infinitives work in many languages.

|Likanu|Latin script|English|
|-|-|-|
| [ʌȷ ɞx̄]{.yellow} [ōı xſɕʃɤı]{.blue}､ [ʋȷ ʌʃʜȷ]{.green}: | [te makan]{.yellow} [in kuwosi]{.blue}, [le tope]{.green}. | [eating]{.yellow} [fruit]{.blue} [is good]{.green}. |

$ta functions like $te, except that it doesn't mark the first word that follows it as a verb, so the clause may start with a subject or any other preposition. It is simple to use when not modifying a noun.

|Likanu|Latin script|English|
|-|-|-|
| [ʌ ɞı]{.red} [ʋȷ ɞx̄]{.green} [ōı xſɕʃɤı]{.blue}､ [ʋȷ ʌʃʜȷ]{.green}: | [ta mi]{.red} [le makan]{.green} [in kuwosi]{.blue}, [le tope]{.green}. | [It]{.red}'[s good]{.green} that [I]{.red} [eat]{.green} [fruit]{.blue}. |
| [ɞı]{.red} [ʋȷ ʜ̄ʃ]{.green} ʌ [ʌſ]{.red} [ʋȷ ʜɤ̄]{.green}: | [mi]{.red} [le pon]{.green} ta [tu]{.red} [le pasan]{.green}. | [I]{.red} [cause]{.green} that [you]{.red} [are happy]{.green}. / [I]{.red} [make]{.green} [you]{.red} [happy]{.green}. |

When $ta does modify a noun, it is more complicated. $te tells you that the noun being modified is the **subject** of the following clause, $ta doesn't say anything about the role of the noun being modified in the clause.

$nin $ta $mi $le $suki might seem like a direct translation from English "person that I like", but in Kokanu it's meaningless. The clause $mi $le $suki sits next to the word $nin with no relation between them. It would be like saying in English "place that I go". You have to establish the role of "place" in the clause "I go", i.e. "place that I go **to**" where "to" tells you that "place" is the direction/goal of the clause "I go". Kokanu does this in a very similar way.

|Likanu|Latin script|English|
|-|-|-|
| [ƨ̄ı]{.red} ʌ [ɞı]{.red} [ʋȷ ɤſxı]{.green} [ōı]{.blue} | [nin]{.red} ta [mi]{.red} [le suki]{.red} [in]{.blue} | [person]{.red} that [I]{.red} [like]{.green} ($in indicates the role of $nin in the **relative clause**) |

|Likanu|Latin script|English|
|-|-|-|
| [ɞı]{.red} [ʋȷ ɤſxı]{.green} [ōı ƨ̄ı]{.blue}: | [mi]{.red} [le suki]{.green} [in nin]{.blue}. | [I]{.red} [like]{.green} [the person]{.blue}. |
| [ƨ̄ı]{.red} ʌ [ɞı]{.red} [ʋȷ ɤſxı]{.green} [ōı]{.blue} | [nin]{.red} ta [mi]{.red} [le suki]{.green} [in]{.blue} | [person]{.red} that [I]{.red} [like]{.green} |

Any **preposition** can be used to make this relation.

|Likanu|Latin script|English|
|-|-|-|
| [ɂ̄]{.red} ʌ [ɞı]{.red} [ʋȷ ʋʃ]{.green} [xı]{.yellow} | jan{.red} ta [mi]{.red} [le lo]{.green} [ki]{.yellow} | place{.red} that [I]{.red} [go]{.green} [to]{.yellow} |
| [ɂ̄ʃ]{.red} ʌ [ɞı]{.red} [ʋȷ ʌ̄ſ]{.green} [ōı ƨȷ]{.blue} [ɕıɂ]{.yellow} | jon{.red} ta [mi]{.red} [le tun]{.green} [in ne]{.blue} [wija]{.yellow} | tool{.red} that [I]{.red} [do]{.green} [this]{.blue} [with]{.yellow} |

The **preposition** at the end of the clause is called a "dangling preposition", and it's the preposition that would have been used on the modified noun in a normal sentence, e.g. "**the place** that I go **to**," "I go **to the place**" 

Alternatively, unlike in English, the clause can be written out as a full sentence, where $ja refers back to the noun being modified. 

|Likanu|Latin script|
|-|-|
| [ƨ̄ı]{.red} ʌ [ōı ɂ]{.blue} [ɞ̄ȷ ɞı]{.red} [ʋȷ ɤſxı]{.green} | [nin]{.red} ta [in ja]{.blue} [men mi]{.red} [le suki]{.green} |
| [ƨ̄ı]{.red} ʌ [ɞı]{.red} [ōı ɂ]{.blue} [ʋȷ ɤſxı]{.green} | [nin]{.red} ta [mi]{.red} [in ja]{.blue} [le suki]{.green} |
| [ƨ̄ı]{.red} ʌ [ɞı]{.red} [ʋȷ ɤſxı]{.green} [ōı ɂ]{.blue} | [nin]{.red} ta [mi]{.red} [le suki]{.green} [in ja]{.blue} |

In the last example, $ja can be dropped from the end, leaving the dangling preposition, which is how it's always done in English.

In any case, the clause must end with a comma if more follows.

|Likanu|Latin script|
|-|-|
| [xſɕʃɤı]{.red} ʌ [ƨ̄ı]{.red} [ʋȷ ɞx̄]{.green} [ōı]{.blue}､ [ʋȷ ʌʃʜȷ]{.green}: | [kuwosi]{.red} ta [nin]{.red} [le makan]{.green} [in]{.blue}, [le tope]{.green}. |

### Derivational Markers

$wi and $mu are markers that apply to an arbitrary amount of words (often one, but can be more). $wi forces words into **modifiers**, and is often used in the construction $wi $no to negate adjectives, and to change the intensity of an adjective.

|Likanu|Latin script|English|
|-|-|-|
| ɤıx̄ı ɕı ƨʃ xʃƨ̄ȷ | sikin wi no konen | improbable event |
| ɤıx̄ı ɕı ƨʃ xʃƨ̄ȷ | kuwosi wi no makan | inedible fruit |

For more information, see [the page on wi](special-words/wi.md).

$mu constructs a noun that is a "doer" of an action, or the **agent** of the action.

|Likanu|Latin script|English|
|-|-|-|
| ɞſ xƨıɤ | mu kanisa | thinker |

To make the **agent** _cause_ the action rather than _do_ the action, you can replace $mu with $pan.

|Likanu|Latin script|English|
|-|-|-|
| ɞſ ʌıxſ | mu tiku | dier |
| ʜ̄ ʌıxſ | pan tiku | killer |
