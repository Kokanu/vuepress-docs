### peko! Welcome to Kokanu!

So you have decided to learn a simple and small language to be able to speak with people from everywhere, but you don't like all the linguistics talk? Fear no more, here we will be learning Kokanu step by step with simple examples. The course is dividided in the following lessons: 

0. [Pronunciation and Spelling](./pronunciation.md)  
1. [Basic Sentences](./basic-sentences.md)
2. [Complex Sentences](./complex-sentences.md)
3. [Derivations](./derivations.md)
4. [Tense, Aspect, Mood](./tense_aspect_mood.md)
5. This, that, questions and relative Clauses (na, ne, ci, ka, ta, te)
6. Advanced Vocabulary
7. Numbers and Maths
8. Special Words

When a new word appears in the course, it will be **bolded**; its meaning should be obvious with the translation of the sentence; but if it is not, or if you have forgot it, look for it in [the dictionary](https://dictionary.kokanu.com).

If you are finished with the course, join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/fMAfGRkGvQ) or read some [texts](/texts.md) in Kokanu.
