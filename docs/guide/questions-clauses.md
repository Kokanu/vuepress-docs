# 5. Clauses and Questions

Kokanu provides two main tools for building questions and complex sentences: **demonstratives** (including *ci* as a question marker), the yes/no particle **ka**, and the clause markers **ta** and **te**. Together they allow both precise questioning and flexible sentence nesting.

---

## 5.1 Demonstratives

Kokanu has three demonstratives: **ne**, **na**, and **ci**.  
- **ne** → “this”  
- **na** → “that”  
- **ci** → interrogative determiner (“which / what / where / why”)

**Examples:**

| Kokanu phrase             | Meaning                   |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **loso**                  | bad                       |
| **ne le loso**            | this is bad               |
| **mi le suki in na pawo** | I like that dog           |

::: warning
Demonstratives only go after the word they modify **if they are replacing an adjective**. Otherwise, demonstratives **always go before the word they modify**:  
*mi le makan in **kuwosi na*** → "I eat **that kind of** apple"
*mi le suki **in na pawo*** → "I like that dog" (not *in pawo na*)
:::

---

### **ci as a Question Word**

By replacing the item of inquiry with **ci**, any interrogative can be formed.

**Examples:**

| Kokanu phrase                    | Meaning                          |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **tu le makan in ci?**           | What do you eat?                 |
| **ja le makan konje nenka ci?**  | Why do they stop eating?         |
| **pawo le antomi pi ci?**        | Where/When does the dog sleep?   |

Sometimes, **ci** can be placed after a word to signify that it's asking for an adjective, instead of a word:

| Kokanu phrase                        | Meaning                               |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **pawo le antomi pi jan ci?**        | The dog is asleep at a *what* place? |
| **pawo le antomi pi ci jan?**        | Where is the dog asleep? |
| **pawo le antomi pi ten ci?**        | The dog is asleep at a *what* time? |
| **pawo le antomi pi ci ten?**        | When is the dog asleep? |
| **canwa ci le makan in makan mi?**        | A *what* animal ate my food? |
| **ci canwa le makan in makan mi?**        | What animal ate my food? |

::: tip New Words
- **loso** = bad  
- **pawo** = dog  
- **jan** = place  
- **ten** = time  
- **canwa** = animal  
:::

---

## 5.2 The Particle **ka**

Yes–no questions are formed with **ka**. It can appear at the start, end, or both.

**Examples:**

| Kokanu phrase                  | Meaning               |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **ka ne makan le tope ka?**    | Is this food good?    |
| **ka tu le antomi?**           | Do you sleep?         |
| **pata le okutu ka?**          | Is the book hidden?   |

::: tip New Words
- **okutu** = hidden, covered  
- **pata** = book  
- **tope** = good  
- **antomi** = asleep / to sleep  
:::

---

## 5.3 The Clause Marker **ta**

**ta** introduces subclauses. Kokanu has two types, similar to English:  
- **Adverbial clauses** (because, when, if…)  
- **Relative clauses** (that, which…)

---

### **Adverbial Clauses**

Placed after a preposition, a *ta*-clause behaves like a main clause.

**Examples:**

| Kokanu phrase                                                                 | Meaning                                      |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **mi le suki in na makan nenka ta sapole ja le tope**                         | I like that food because its flavor is good  |
| **mi le wisan in ta tu le makan in makan mi** / **mi le wisan ta tu le makan in makan mi** | I know that you ate my food |

::: tip New Words
- **sapole** = to taste (a flavor)  
- **wisan** = to know  
:::

---

### **Closing Clauses**

Every subclause must be closed (unless final in the sentence).  
Closers are: **comma (,)**, **hu**, or **wa**.  
- *hu* is used only to close clauses.  
- *wa* is explained in Chapter 6.

**Examples:**

| Kokanu phrase (variants)                                               | Meaning                        |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **po ta tu le sema in kota mi, men mi le kota len**                    | I speak loud so you hear what I say |
| **po ta tu le sema in kota mi hu men mi le kota len**                  | same meaning, with *hu* closer |

::: tip New Words
- **len** = strong  
- **sema** = to hear  
- **kota** = to say / speech  
:::

---

### **Relative Clauses**

A *ta*-clause follows the word it describes. Inside, **ja** refers back to that word. If the clause ends with a sole **ja** in a preposition, that **ja** can be dropped.  
A relative clause must describe the relation between the clause and the word that it describes. "nin ta mi le suki" is incomplete, because it doesn't explain how "mi le suki" and "nin" are related to each other. The correct way would be "nin ta mi le suki in (ja)".

**Examples:**

| Kokanu phrase                      | Meaning                      |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **nin ta in ja men mi le suki**    | a person that I like         |
| **pawo ta mi le makan in makan ja**| a dog, whose food I ate      |
| **jan ta mi le pasan pi ja**       | a place at which I’m happy   |
| **jan ta mi le pasan pi**          | a place I’m happy at         |

::: tip New Words
- **nin** = person  
- **pasan** = happy  
:::

---

### **Nested Clauses**

*ta*-clauses can be nested, collapsing inside → out.

**Example:**

- *mi le kujo nenka ta pi ta mi le koman, men tu le cuma*  
  → “I am sad because you leave when I come.”

::: tip New Words
- **kujo** = sad  
- **koman** = arriving  
- **cuma** = leaving  
:::

Clauses can be closed in multiple ways, sometimes stacking multiple closers to avoid ambiguity:

| Kokanu phrase (variants)                                               | Meaning                                  |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **nenka ta tu le cuma hon ta mi le koman, men mi le kujo**                  | I am sad because you leave when I come   |
| **nenka ta tu le cuma hon ta mi le koman,, men mi le kujo**             | (same, but multiple , used)        |
| **nenka ta tu le cuma hon ta mi le koman hu, men mi le kujo**             | (same, but hu used)        |
| **nenka ta tu le cuma hon ta mi le koman hu hu men mi le kujo**             | (same, but multiple hu used)        |

---

### **Indirect Questions**

Indirect questions are formed by adding **ka** into a *ta*-clause. Just like with regular questions, it can go at the beginning and at the end of the clause.

::: warning
If your sentence ends with **ka** at the end of a *ta*-clause, some ambiguity can arise. Make sure to close the *ta*-clause in order to ask a regular question, or put *ka* at the start of the sentence or clause instead to avoid this.
:::

| Kokanu phrase                      | Meaning                      |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **tu le solu ta ka mi le makan** |  You ask whether I eat.  |
| **mi le no wisan ta ka mi le suki in na nin** | I don't know whether I like that person. |
| **mi le no wisan ta mi le suki in na nin ka** | I don't know whether I like that person. |
| **mi le no wisan ta mi le suki in na nin hu, ka** | Do I not know that I like that person? |

---

## 5.4 The Clause Marker **te**

**te** is similar to *ta*, but with key differences:  
1. A *te*-clause cannot have a subject.  
2. It implies **le**.  

---

### **Relative Clauses**

*te* is equivalent to *ta ja le*:

| Kokanu phrase                            | Meaning                      |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **nin ta ja le suki in mi**              | a person who likes me        |
| **nin te suki in mi**                    | same meaning                 |

---

### **Adverbial Clauses**

As an adverbial clause, *te* acts like an infinitive clause in English:

| Kokanu phrase                     | Meaning              |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------|
| **mi le ju (in) te makan**        | I like to eat        |
| **te pata, le tope**              | To read is good / Reading is good |
| **te makan in kuwosi, le tope**   | Eating fruits is good |

::: tip New Words
- **ju** = to want / to like  
- **pata** = to read  
- **kuwosi** = fruit
