# 3. Word Derivations

Kokanu’s grammar provides **extreme flexibility** in how words can be repurposed: any **noun**, **verb**, or **modifier** can be systematically converted into the other forms. This feature keeps the vocabulary minimal while preserving expressiveness.

---

### 3.1 Modifier → Verb

When a **modifier** follows a verb marker (like **le** or **o**), it effectively becomes a verb meaning “to be [modifier]”.

**Examples:**

| Kokanu phrase              | Meaning                       |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| antomi                     | asleep (modifier)             |
| **mi le antomi**           | I am asleep / I sleep         |
| **tu le cenpo**            | you are big                   |
| **le lijule men momu**     | the bovine is laughing / laughs |

::: tip New Words
- **antomi** = asleep (modifier)  
- **cenpo** = big  
- **lijule** = laughing  
- **momu** = bovine  
:::

::: warning
Here, **le** is not a “to be” verb. The modifier itself becomes a verb when used in this position.
:::

### 3.2 Noun → Verb

A **noun** can function as a verb when placed after **le**, meaning “to be [noun]”.

**Examples:**

| Kokanu phrase              | Meaning                |
|----------------------------|------------------------|
| canwa                      | animal (noun)          |
| **mi le canwa**            | I am an animal         |
| suwina                     | pig (noun)             |
| **canwa le suwina**        | the animal is a pig    |

::: tip New Words
- **canwa** = animal  
- **suwina** = pig  
:::

---

### 3.3 Modifier → Noun

A **modifier** used as a noun becomes the abstract concept of “[modifier]-ness”.

**Examples:**

| Kokanu phrase                | Meaning                            |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| pilu                          | victorious / successful (modifier) |
| **mi le ju in pilu**          | I want success                     |
| tonko                         | hurting / suffering (modifier)     |
| **tu le ikasi wija tonko**    | you learned through suffering      |

::: tip New Words
- **pilu** = victorious / successful  
- **ikasi** = to learn  
- **tonko** = hurting / suffering  
:::

::: warning
Kokanu often favors conceptual nuance over literal one-to-one translation. Literal renderings can sound verbose in English.
:::

### 3.4 Verb → Noun

A **verb** used as a noun becomes its generic object aka what one generally does with that verb.

**Examples:**

| Kokanu phrase               | Meaning                  |
|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| makan (verb)                 | to eat → food (noun)     |
| **mi le makan in makan**     | I eat food               |
| **mi le ju in makan**        | I want food              |
| lika (verb)                  | to write → text (noun)   |
| **mi le suki in lika tu**    | I like your text         |
| cawapu (verb)                | to answer (a response, an answer)   |
| **mi le kota in cawapu**     | I say a response         |

::: tip New Words
- **makan** = to eat → food  
- **lika** = to write → text  
- **cawapu** = to answer (a response)  
:::

::: warning
Remember Chapter 1.3: Kokanu’s **direct object** usage may differ from English.  
The noun form of a verb may not match your intuition (e.g., **cawapu** = to answer a *response*, not a question).  
The dictionary lists all noun/verb/modifier forms explicitly.
:::

### 3.5 Noun → Modifier

A **noun** used as a modifier means “[noun]-related,” often broadly.

**Examples:**

| Kokanu phrase                  | Meaning                        |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **makan pawo le tope**         | the dog food is good           |
| **mi le onton in onton sila**    | I wear head-related clothing   |

::: tip New Words
- **makan** = food  
- **pawo** = dog  
- **tope** = good  
- **onton** = to wear (clothing)  
- **sila** = head  
:::

---

### 3.6 Verb → Modifier

A **verb** as a modifier means “-able” (something that can be verb-ed), or “[verb]-like”.

**Examples:**

| Kokanu phrase                 | Meaning                       |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **kuwosi makan**              | edible fruit / food-like fruit |
| **men cawapu solu**           | question-like answer          |

::: tip New Words
- **kuwosi** = fruit  
- **makan** = to eat → food  
- **solu** = to ask (a question)  
- **cawapu** = to answer (a response)  
:::
