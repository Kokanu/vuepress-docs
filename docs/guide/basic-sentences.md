# 1. Basic Grammar

---

### 1.1 Content Words

In Kokanu, all **content words** belong to one of three categories:

- **Nouns**
- **Verbs**
- **Modifiers**

Although a word’s category and its usage don’t always have to match (verbs can be used as nouns, etc. — see Chapter 3), here we will start using them in their **base form**.  

The main verb in a sentence is usually marked by **le** (exceptions in 2.2 and 5.4). In the simplest case, the **subject** goes right before it.  

**Examples:**

| Kokanu         | English   |
|----------------|-----------|
| mi         |      I     |
| makan   | eat/drink       |
| **mi le makan** | I eat    |
| tu        |      you     |
| kota    |    speak       |
| **tu le kota** | you speak |

### 1.2 Pronouns

Besides content words, Kokanu also has **pronouns**. There are five:

| Pronoun | Meaning           |
|---------|-------------------|
| mi      | I / we            |
| tu      | you               |
| ja      | they / them       |
| sa      | self              |
| usen    | each other        |

::: warning
Like any other word in Kokanu, pronouns do **not** carry grammatical information.  
- “I / me” and “we / us” use the same word (**mi**).  
- Likewise, there is no distinction between “he / she / it / they / them” → all use **ja**.

### 1.3 Direct Objects

In Kokanu, every **base verb** is **transitive** (for intransitives, see Chapter 3).  
This means one can always form a **direct object**, marked by **in**.  

The direct object, like the subject, must be a **noun** or **pronoun**.  

**Examples:**

| Kokanu sentence                | English meaning          |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **tu le makan in kuwosi**      | you eat a fruit          |
| **ja le teka in kuku**         | they see a bird          |
| **mi le makan in pani**        | I drink (lit. eat liquid)|
| **ukiki le suki in tu**        | the monkey likes you     |

::: tip New Words
- **kuwosi** = fruit  
- **teka** = to see  
- **kuku** = bird  
- **pani** = water, liquid  
- **ukiki** = monkey  
- **suki** = to like  
:::

::: warning
The direct object in Kokanu may differ from English.  
For example: in English you *answer a question*; in Kokanu you *answer a response*.  
:::

Some verbs come with a built-in preposition. For instance:  
- **sitija** = to sit on → the direct object is the thing someone sits on.  

The Kokanu dictionary shows this explicitly:  
```amo · verb · to love (a loved entity). See 3.4.```

### 1.4 Modifiers

The last word type are **modifiers**. As the name suggests, they **modify other words**.  

- They can act on both **verbs** and **nouns**.  
- In English terms, they are both **adjectives** and **adverbs**.  
- A chain of modifiers collectively modifies the preceding word.  
- A pronoun used as a modifier becomes a **possessive pronoun**.  

**Examples:**

| Kokanu sentence                         | English meaning                |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **mi le makan wiki in kuwosi hunsi**    | I quickly eat a red fruit      |
| **pawo cenpo le teka in sa**            | the big dog sees itself        |
| **insu cenpo hunsi**                    | red big building               |
| **pawo mi**                             | my dog                         |
| **kuwosi ja**                           | their fruit                    |
