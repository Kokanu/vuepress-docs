# 4. Tense, Aspect, and Mood

Kokanu does not mark tense, aspect, or mood in its base word forms.  
Instead, these distinctions are expressed with **modifiers**, which behave like ordinary words.  
This makes Kokanu flexible, minimal, and context-driven.  

---

### 4.1 Tense

In Kokanu, verbs themselves carry **no tense**.  
By default, the time of an action is inferred from context, left irrelevant, or indicated in a **pi-clause**.  

For explicit marking, Kokanu uses **three tense modifiers**:  

| Modifier | Meaning   |
|----------|-----------|
| **matin** | past      |
| **kenca** | present   |
| **melon** | future    |

**Examples:**

| Kokanu phrase                   | English meaning   |
|---------------------------------|-------------------|
| **le lika kenca men mi**        | I write (now)     |
| **pawo le makan melon in niku** | the dog will eat meat |
| **tu le teka matin in mi**      | you saw me        |

Instead of adding the time as a sort-of adverb, it works like this using a pi-clause:

- **tu le teka in mi pi matin** - you saw me / you see me in the past

::: tip New Words
- **matin** = past  
- **kenca** = present  
- **melon** = future  
- **lika** = to write  
- **niku** = meat  
- **teka** = to see  
:::

::: warning
All tense, aspect, and mood markers are **ordinary modifiers** in Kokanu.  
They have a special function in grammar, but can also behave like other modifiers.

### 4.2 Aspect

Aspect modifiers describe how an event unfolds over time, independent of when it happens.  

| Modifier | Meaning                 |
|----------|-------------------------|
| **tepu** | starting / inceptive    |
| **konje**| ending / terminative    |
| **conpu**| repeating / frequentative |
| **conca**| ongoing / progressive   |
| **lito** | unstarted / prospective |
| **mulu** | completed / perfect     |
| **luka** | interrupted / pausative |

**Examples:**

| Kokanu phrase                   | English meaning                    |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **mi le antomi tepu**           | I start sleeping / I fall asleep   |
| **mi le antomi konje**          | I stop sleeping / I wake up        |
| **mi le antomi conpu**          | I sleep repeatedly / I often sleep |
| **mi le antomi conca**          | I am sleeping (right now)          |
| **mi le antomi lito**           | I am about to sleep / I haven’t started sleeping |
| **mi le antomi mulu**           | I am done sleeping                 |
| **mi le antomi luka**           | I sleep interruptedly / I was sleeping but woke for a moment |

::: tip New Words
- **antomi** = asleep (modifier → verb: to sleep)  
- **tepu** = starting  
- **konje** = ending  
- **conpu** = repeating  
- **conca** = ongoing  
- **lito** = unstarted, prospective  
- **mulu** = complete, perfect  
- **luka** = interrupted

#### Tense vs. Aspect

The difference between **tense** and **aspect** can feel unintuitive.  
Compare the following:  

| Kokanu phrase                  | Meaning                                  |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **ja le pen lito matin**       | back then, they hadn’t started to understand |
| **ja le pen mulu melon**       | someday, they will have understood       |

::: warning
Mixing tense and aspect shows they are not the same.  
For example, **ja le pen matin melon** (“they understood in the future, in the past”) is paradoxical.
:::

::: tip New Words
- **pen** = to understand

### 4.3 Mood

Kokanu expresses **mood** through special particles.  
Unlike tense and aspect, mood is less about time and more about the **speaker’s attitude** toward the action.  

#### The particle **o**

The particle **o** is very versatile:  
- **Imperative**: commands (*do X!*)  
- **Suggestive**: proposals (*let’s do X*)  
- **Optative**: wishes (*may X happen*)  

| Kokanu phrase           | Meaning                        |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **o teka in mi**         | look at me! (imperative)      |
| **lan mi o makan in kuwosi**    | let’s eat / we shall eat a fruit (suggestive) |
| **o tope pi melon**      | may you be fine in the future (optative) |

#### Other mood markers

- **hon** — context / if → used for **conditionals**  
- **kate** — hypothetical (“as if”, counterfactual)  
- **hakiki** — authentic, realis (“indeed, actually”)  

| Kokanu phrase                               | Meaning                                        |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **hon ta tu le pata, men mi le pasan**      | When you read, I am happy                      |
| **hon ta tu le pata kate, men mi le pasan** | If you would read, I'd be happy (hypothetical) |
| **mi le suki hakiki in pawo mi**            | I really love my dog (authentic)               |

::: warning
**ta** introduces a separate clause. Simply put, it allows you to split parts of the sentence from others, like "tu le pata kate" and "mi le pasan".  
It will be explained further in chapter 5.
:::

::: tip New Words
- **o** = imperative / suggestive / optative marker  
- **hon** = context / if (conditional)  
- **kate** = hypothetical (as if)  
- **hakiki** = authentic / realis  
- **pata** = to read  
- **kuwosi** = fruit  
- **tope** = good
