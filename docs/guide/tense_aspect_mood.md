# 4. Tense, Aspect, and Mood

Kokanu does not mark tense, aspect, or mood in its base word forms.  
Instead, these distinctions are expressed with **modifiers**, which behave like ordinary words.  
This makes Kokanu flexible, minimal, and context-driven.  

---

### 4.1 Tense

In Kokanu, verbs themselves carry **no tense**.  
By default, the time of an action is inferred from context, left irrelevant, or indicated in a **pi-clause**.  

For explicit marking, Kokanu uses **three tense modifiers**:  

| Modifier | Meaning   |
|----------|-----------|
| **matin** | past      |
| **kenca** | present   |
| **melon** | future    |

**Examples:**

| Kokanu phrase                   | English meaning   |
|---------------------------------|-------------------|
| **le kela kenca men mi**        | I play (now)     |
| **pulusi le jatan melon in niku** | the dog will find the meat |
| **tu le sema matin in mi**      | you heard me        |

Instead of adding the time as a sort-of adverb, it works like this using a pi-clause:

- **tu le teka in mi pi matin** - you saw me / you see me in the past

::: tip New Words
- **matin** = past  
- **kenca** = present  
- **melon** = future  
- **jatan** = to find
- **niku** = meat  
- **sema** = to hear  
- **pulusi** = reptile
:::

::: warning
All tense, aspect, and mood markers are **ordinary modifiers** in Kokanu.  
They have a special function in grammar, but can also behave like other modifiers.

### 4.2 Aspect

Aspect modifiers describe how an event unfolds over time, independent of when it happens.  

| Modifier | Meaning                 |
|----------|-------------------------|
| **tepu** | starting / inceptive    |
| **konje**| ending / terminative    |
| **conpu**| repeating / frequentative |
| **conca**| ongoing / progressive   |
| **lito** | unstarted / prospective |
| **mulu** | completed / perfect     |
| **luka** | interrupted / pausative |

**Examples:**

| Kokanu phrase                   | English meaning                    |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **mi le antomi tepu**           | I start sleeping / I fall asleep   |
| **mi le antomi konje**          | I stop sleeping / I wake up        |
| **mi le antomi conpu**          | I sleep repeatedly / I often sleep |
| **mi le antomi conca**          | I am sleeping (right now)          |
| **mi le antomi lito**           | I am about to sleep / I haven’t started sleeping |
| **mi le antomi mulu**           | I am done sleeping                 |
| **mi le antomi luka**           | I sleep interruptedly / I was sleeping but woke for a moment |

::: tip New Words
- **antomi** = asleep (modifier → verb: to sleep)  
- **tepu** = starting  
- **konje** = ending  
- **conpu** = repeating  
- **conca** = ongoing  
- **lito** = unstarted, prospective  
- **mulu** = complete, perfect  
- **luka** = interrupted

#### Tense vs. Aspect

The difference between **tense** and **aspect** can feel unintuitive.  
Compare the following:  

| Kokanu phrase                  | Meaning                                  |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **ja le pen lito matin**       | back then, they hadn’t started to understand |
| **ja le pen mulu melon**       | someday, they will have understood       |

::: warning
Mixing tense and aspect shows they are not the same.  
For example, **ja le pen matin melon** (“they understood in the future, in the past”) is paradoxical.
:::

::: tip New Words
- **pen** = to understand

### 4.3 Mood

Kokanu expresses **mood** through special particles.  
Unlike tense and aspect, mood is less about time and more about the **speaker’s attitude** toward the action.  

#### The particle **o**

The particle **o** is very versatile:  
- **Imperative**: commands (*do X!*)  
- **Suggestive**: proposals (*let’s do X*)  
- **Optative**: wishes (*may X happen*)  

| Kokanu phrase           | Meaning                        |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **o sema ki mi**         | listen to me! (imperative)      |
| **mi o jatan in meja mi**    | lets find my cat/ we should find my cat (suggestive) |
| **o tope pi melon**      | may you be fine in the future (optative) |

::: tip New Words
- **tope** = good
:::

#### Other mood markers

- **hon** — context / if → used for **conditionals** (chapter 5.3)  
- **kate** — hypothetical (“as if”, counterfactual)  
- **hakiki** — authentic, realis (“indeed, actually”)  

| Kokanu phrase                               | Meaning                                        |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **hon konco, men mi le pasan**      | In the context of job/ Regarding my job, I am happy                      |
| **hon pilu kate, men mi le pasan** | In the theoretical context of victory, I'd be happy (hypothetical) |
| **mi le pasan hakiki**            | I am really/actually happy (authentic)               |

::: tip New Words
- **o** = imperative / suggestive / optative marker  
- **hon** = context / if (conditional)  
- **kate** = hypothetical (as if)  
- **hakiki** = authentic / realis  
- **konco** = job/profession  
- **kuwosi** = fruit  
- **tope** = good
