# 2. Complex Sentences

### 2.1 Word Order

Until now, we always used the word order:  
**subject – verb – object**  

But this is not required.  

**Examples:**

| Kokanu sentence                   | Meaning                |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------|
| mi le makan in kuwosi             | I eat a fruit          |
| mi in kuwosi le makan             | I eat a fruit          |

When the **subject is not first**, ambiguity arises:

- **le makan in kuwosi mi** → will be read as *“(someone) eats my fruit”* or *“my fruit is eaten (by someone)”* — which is, in fact, how you form the **passive voice** in Kokanu.

To avoid this, the subject must be marked with **men** when it is not in the first position:

- **in kuwosi le makan men mi**  
- **le makan men mi in kuwosi**  
- (*I eat a fruit*)

It is also allowed at the start:  
- **men mi le makan in kuwosi**

All of these have the same literal meaning. Word order in Kokanu is a **rhetorical choice** and can be used to stress certain parts of the sentence.

### 2.2 Prepositions

Every Kokanu sentence needs a **main verb** (usually the **le-clause**).  
Other parts are optional:  

- **mi le makan** → I eat  
- **le makan in kuwosi** → someone eats a fruit / the fruit gets eaten  

Both **men** and **in** are **prepositions**.  
A preposition treats the word after it like a noun and relates it to the main verb.  

Kokanu has **11 prepositions**:

| Preposition | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| men         | subject marker |
| in          | direct object marker |
| pi          | at / during (time or place) |
| kan         | alongside / with |
| sun         | from |
| po          | for |
| he          | vocative marker |
| nenka       | because |
| hon         | context (surroundings or conditionals) |
| wija        | via / through / using |
| ki          | towards |

::: warning
Some English verbs have **two objects** (direct + indirect).  
In Kokanu, **ki** often marks the **recipient** (the indirect object).

**Example:**

| Kokanu sentence                    | English meaning               |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **ja le tene in mani ki nin**      | they give money to the person / they give the person the money |

- **he** = vocative marker (particle)

### 2.3 Imperative

To form an imperative:  
- Drop the **men** clause  
- Replace **le** with **o**  

**Example:**
- **o kota ki mi** → talk to me!  

To specify who is addressed, use **he**:  

| Kokanu sentence                    | English meaning   |
|------------------------------------|-------------------|
| **he neje o teka ki mi**           | horse, look at me! |

::: tip New Words
- **o** = imperative marker (particle)  
- **he** = vocative marker (particle, repeated here)  
- **neje** = horse

### 2.4 Conjunctions

Kokanu has **four conjunctions**:  

| Conjunction | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| un          | and |
| ili         | or |
| tan         | then |
| lekin       | but |

They can connect **words**, **phrases**, or **sentences**.  

**Examples:**

| Kokanu sentence                              | English meaning                         |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **mi un tu le makan**                        | me and you eat                          |
| **nin le ju in pawo cenpo ili in meja cina** | a person wants a big dog or a small cat |
| **tu le pata, tan tu le makan**              | you read, then you eat                  |
