# 8. Advanced Vocabulary

This chapter **does not** cover any grammar but explanes a couple of vocabulary concepts and how more complex and detailed topics may be described by them. 

## 8.1 Proper Names

Proper names are **always capitalized** just like in english. The difference is that they are the only words capitalized. They work like nouns and should follow Kokanu's phonology.

**Examples:**

| Kokanu         | English   |
|----------------|-----------|
| mi le Malija   |I am Maria |
| Mohame le makan   | Mohamed eats       |
| kanisa je Jose le tope  | Jose's thought is good    |

## 8.2 Directions

### Rellative Directions
Kokanu expresses directiones as base nouns. There are six base directions:

| Kokanu         | English   |
|----------------|-----------|
| jamin |(the) right    |
| pajan | (the) left    |
| polan | (the) forward |
| pice  | (the) back    |
| malo  | (the) up      |
| kali  | (the) down    |

They are used and drived just like any other noun. 

**Examples:**

| Kokanu         | English   |
|----------------|-----------|
| Malija le pi pije tu  |Maria is behind you |
| nin malo le nan te teka in lan | the person above is able to see a lot   |

### Cardinal Directions
Kokanu has no words for cardinal directions (west, east, south, nord). You have to describe them somehow. 

One way to describe them is

| Kokanu         | English   |
|----------------|-----------|
| pi titan je kin je tepu kin | at the direction of the beginning of the day / east |
| pi titan je kin je konje kin | at the direction of the end of the day / west 
|pi titan je jamin kin| atthe direction of the right of the sun / north 
|pi titan je pajan kin|at the direction of the right of the sun / south |

::: tip New Words
- **kin** = sun/day
- **titan** =  way/path
:::

Left and right are both from the perspective of the sun facing towards it's moving direction rellative to the earth. 
Those descriptions however are **not official**. You should allways use whatever is the simples and most natural for you and your conversation partner(s).
