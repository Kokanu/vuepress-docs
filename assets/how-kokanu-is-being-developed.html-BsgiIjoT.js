It was in mid 2021 when development was internally moved to a more structured mechanism on a different discord server and a stable draft was published.</p><p>Ever since 2021, to now, 2025, a lot of work is put in to practice, and iterate on the language.</p><p>In 2023, for example, the entire vocabulary of the language was reworked, mostly because the parent language toki pona did not have vocabulary that met the principle of Neutrality. This is also when &quot;toki ma&quot; was changed into Kokanu, an abbreviation &quot;te kota kan usen&quot;, meaning &quot;To talk with each another&quot;.</p><h2 id="the-discord-committee" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-discord-committee"><span>The Discord Committee</span></a></h2><p>Decisions are taken by the Discord Committee.

Generally, when many languages do things differently, we try to make it such that Kokanu is flexible, and that every language&#39;s speakers can express the concept in their own ways. However, there is limits to this, generally more than 90% of the world doing things in a certain way may be selected as the only way to do something in Kokanu, or certain grammatical choices may be chosen based on other principles first.</p><p>This principle can appear in ways such as:</p><ul><li>The words of Kokanu are sourced roughly proportionally to the first language distribution of the world.</li><li>Kokanu has free word order, so that people can express their thoughts in their preferred order</li></ul><h3 id="ʜsɛs-ɂȷ-ɞıʌ-ɞȷƨs-pucun-je-mita-menu-minimalism" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ʜsɛs-ɂȷ-ɞıʌ-ɞȷƨs-pucun-je-mita-menu-minimalism"><span>ʜſɛ̄ſ ɂȷ ɞıʌ ɞȷƨſ | pucun je mita menu | Minimalism</span></a></h3><p>This is the principle that most definitively separates Kokanu from other IAL attempts. Kokanu tries to keep things, especially Vocabulary, as minimal as possible</p><p>To see how this principle is exercised, check out the <a href="#vocabulary-principles">Vocabulary Principles</a> section</p><h3 id="ʜsɛs-ɂȷ-ʌʃɞıɕ-pucun-je-tomiwa-practicality" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ʜsɛs-ɂȷ-ʌʃɞıɕ-pucun-je-tomiwa-practicality"><span>ʜſɛ̄ſ ɂȷ ʌʃɞıɕ | pucun je tomiwa | Practicality</span></a></h3><p>This is a rather vague principle, but essentially this boils down to: the language should not feel unnatural, and should be able to express normal language things rather succinctly</p><p>To see how this principle is exercised, check out the <a href="#vocabulary-principles">Vocabulary Principles</a> section</p><h2 id="vocabulary-principles" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vocabulary-principles"><span>Vocabulary Principles</span></a></h2><p>Derived from the Kokanu principles listed above, most notably the Minimalism and Practicality principles, to add a new word in Kokanu, people must give a justification using these principles. A justification is to be given relative to the minimal precedent already present in the language, something like if X word already exists, this rule should also make Y word exist since the rule applies more to it than X.</p><p>These discussions are still very subjective, but these rules give a structure to discussion.</p><h3 id="ʜsɛs-ɤʌʋ-pucun-satalan-the-normal-clause" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ʜsɛs-ɤʌʋ-pucun-satalan-the-normal-clause"><span>ʜſɛ̄ſ ɤʌʋ̄ | pucun satalan | The Normal Clause</span></a></h3><p><em>If a necessary/common concept can not be precisely expressed in Kokanu, it needs the sufficient vocabulary necessary to express it.</em></p><p>Necessity and preciseness are based on precedent and other words that are admitted under normal clause.</p><p>For example, we did not have a word for think, we needed to say some compound &quot;feel&quot; or &quot;know&quot; or &quot;head&quot;.
